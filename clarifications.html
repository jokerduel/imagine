        In 2013 I manually copied the Yahoo Group rules digests Q/A to a text file my computer to make searching for cards easier. After the Yahoo Groups was shut down is was the only surviving backup of the data. The original text file is hosted <a href="https://jokerduel.github.io/magination/clarifications.html">here</a>.
        <br>
      The clarifications on this page was created by using an LLM to parse the original document and split it into a Question / Answer format. The LLM transformed and simplified the text so there may be hallucinations or other inaccuracies. When in doubt, check the original rules document.
      <br>
        There was a much smaller Magi-Nation Duel Rules Compendium that summarized some earlier rulings. For these the LLM created hypothetical questions to fit the dataset.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        If my deck has multiple cards that CAN be Starting Cards, can I draw all of those cards into my hand?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Each Magi's listed starting cards can only be retrieved once. For example, if your Magi has listed "Starting: Eebit, Weebo, Grow," you can only get one Eebit, one Weebo, and one Grow. Remember that non-Magi cards that have "Starting: <Magi Name>" on them are simply edits to the Magi's starting card list. When Krawg says "Starting: Ashgar," that just means that Ashgar now has Krawg added to his starting card list. So you can only get a single Krawg as a starting card for Ashgar; you can't retrieve all the Krawgs you're playing with.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        Can you use Shadow Cloak or Shell before bringing creatures into play, and will they protect those creatures from opposing spells and powers such as Corrupt?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, both Shadow Cloak and Shell can be used before playing creatures, and they will protect the next creature(s) played (assuming it's Orothe for Shell) from effects like Corrupt, which would discard the creature. While Corrupt is a Core Spell and not affected by Shadow Cloak, the protective effect of Shell still applies to the creature entering play.

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Since I can process my effects in the order that I want them to occur, if I have M'Rika out and Voda is my next Magi, can I interchange out and then process Voda's Deluge to add 4 to the biggest creature?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You must process Deluge since it will still be the same part of your turn, and Voda's Deluge is not optional.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Can I use Furok Guardian's effect more than once per turn? And if I discard a creature, bring it back with Furok Guardian, can I use that creature's power again since it returns as a new version of itself?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You can use Furok Guardian's effect as many times per turn as you have energy to pay. If you have 15 energy and discard three of your creatures one at a time, you could spend 5 energy each to return them all at the end of the turn. The Guardian would then be discarded due to having no energy left. Since the creature returns at the end of the turn, it cannot use its power immediately (as that step has already passed). However, if the creature had a power that could be used later in the turn or during future turns, yes—you could use it again because returning from discard creates a new version of the same creature. Note: Furok Guardian's Terra Rebirth triggers only on single discards, not multiple simultaneous discards (like those caused by Tidal Wave), so each discard must be separate.
      </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Can I play another copy of Agram's Plaything after morphing it into a creature with Puppet Strings, since the original now counts as a creature and there is no limit on the number of same-named creatures in play?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You cannot play another copy of Agram's Plaything because you can only play Relics if no card you control has the same name. Even though the original Agram's Plaything is now a creature due to being morphed, it still counts as having the same name, so playing another copy would violate the rule against duplicate named cards in play.
      </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Does choosing a region to target with Wildfire constitute a specific reference to core that would be affected by Ashio's Weave Twist?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Choosing a region doesn't cause that choice to appear in print on the card (where it would be affected by Weave Twist). Your assumption is correct.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If Abwyns Quill is used to make a card reference core, does that trigger Ashio's Weave Twist effect?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Ashio's Weave Twist checks on the reference constantly—if you changed it with Quill, the Weave Twist would immediately change it back.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Can Arderial use Abwyns Quill to make an anti-core card target core again, and what happens in that case?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, and as stated above, the Weave Twist would change it back immediately.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        When an opposing creature is discarded from play by one of your cards, do you draw a card with Evil Evu? Specifically, does using Syphon Stone to reduce a creature's energy to zero count as discarding it from play, and does defeating a creature in battle also trigger Evil Evu's effect?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, you draw a card when an opposing creature is discarded from play by one of your cards. This includes reducing a creature's energy to zero with Syphon Stone or defeating a creature in battle, as both actions result in the creature being removed from play.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        When using Hrada's Tainted Touch on a Magi, can that Magi still play relics from their original region?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Tainted Touch only allows the Magi to play Creatures and Spells; as such, the Magi is cut off from playing relics from their original region as they normally would. However, if a relic specifically allows the Shadow Magi of that region to play it, it may still be playable under Tainted Touch.
      </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If there is a 1 energy Wellisk in play and you play Koil, would Wellisk's Dream Barrier effect discard Koil and its energy first, or would Koil's Nightmare effect discard the one energy from Wellisk first, killing it?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The active player processes their effects first, so Koil would plink the Wellisk before the Wellisk could discard the Koil.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        With Rayje's Cloak, would it prevent Sorreah's Suppress?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, absolutely. That is one of the express purposes of Rayje's Cloak.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        What is the correct wording for the Recirculation rule in Magi-Nation Duel, and where is it officially published?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        During your Draw Step, if you are required to draw one or more cards and there are none left in your deck, immediately shuffle your discard pile into your deck and draw the remaining cards as needed. You may only recirculate your discard into your deck in this manner once per turn. If you need to draw from an empty deck a second time during your Draw Step, or if you need to do so for any reason outside your Draw Step, you simply do not get to draw the needed cards. There is no penalty for not being able to draw in these situations, nor do any Effects that normally are activated upon drawing a card come into play.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        What happens when you cast Vortex of Knowledge or multiple Vortices on Step 2 with only one card left? Do you draw just that one card?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, you draw only the one card remaining in your deck.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        What about casting Spectral Shield on Step 2 with only one card left?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You still gain a shield counter as normal, regardless of how many cards are left in your deck.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        What does Lascinth's 'Reflex' ability do, and why is it useful?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Lascinth's Reflexes effect allows it to remove its opponent's energy before the opponent can remove its energy, normally happening simultaneously. If this early removal causes the opponent to lose all their energy, the creature dies immediately, preventing them from dealing damage in return.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        What happens when you 'lockdown' Lockdown? Do existing effects from the previous Lockdown go away, and how can the second Lockdown function?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Previous one-shot effects are not retroactively removed—damage already dealt remains. However, ongoing effects (such as preventing spell plays or reducing combat damage) are suppressed and cannot be used while the Lockdown is active. If you Lockdown Lockdown, all Lockdowns in play—including your own—are silenced, meaning you cannot access your Belt to repeat the action until the initial Lockdown ends.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If Rock Slide is used and the biggest creature in play cannot be disregarded from play, does it automatically work on the next biggest creature?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        It comes down to the wording on the card. If the creature says "cannot be discarded from play..." then the Rock Slide cannot be played at all. If the creature says "is not affected by Spells, etc. that specifically discard..." then the Rock Slide can be played but has no effect. In any case it doesn't revert to the second largest in play.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If my opponent drops a Belt and names Burrow, and I steal it with a Cube, is Burrow still locked down?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes. Gaining control of a card that did something does not mean that whatever it did previously is undone.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Do cards lose memory if they switch sides of the table?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Generally speaking, no. If there are exceptions, it will mention it on the card.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If I bring into play Warriors Boots during my first PRS step and instantly use them to bring out a Junjertrug, can I then play another Warriors Boots in the same PRS step to bring out another creature?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes. Junjertrug must attack each turn if able, but that does not mean that as soon as you play him, you must immediately switch to your Attack Step.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If I have a card in play that allows me to pay one less Energy to play a Creature (ex: Swamp Hyren's Effect), when my Creature hits the table, does it get its Starting Energy or the amount of energy I spent to play it (in this case, one less energy)?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Paying energy to bring out a creature is not the same as sliding energy counters from your Magi to the creature. The energy is actually and truly lost when you use it to play a creature, and then when the creature enters play, it comes in with whatever its Starting Energy is listed as. So if you want to bring in a 5-energy creature, you pay 5e from your Magi, and then it comes in with 5e. If you have a card that allows you a discount on that cost — say, Shadow Tony Jones — then you would pay 4e, but the creature would still come in with energy equal to its starting energy — i.e., 5e.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        How does Jungle Hyren's ability work when playing a 5e creature? If I twist it to 7e, do I pay 7 energy and it starts with 7 energy? Does this also apply if I twist it down to 3e?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You've got it correct. Jungle Hyren's ability lets you alter the Starting Energy of the creature you play, ranging from 3 to 7. If you choose to play it as a 7e creature, you pay its Starting Energy cost (7 energy), and it enters play with 7 energy. Similarly, if you twist it down to 3e, you pay 3 energy and it starts with 3 energy. The changed Starting Energy only lasts until the end of the turn, but this does not affect the current amount of energy on the creature while in play.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        When forced to discard a card by Protect, my opponent discards Abraxin's Crown. Can I use Deep Wellisk's Sunken Treasure effect to prevent the Crown from knocking out my hand and energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No. Sunken Treasure only applies when a card is played, not when it is discarded. Since Abraxin's Crown was discarded rather than played, its effect resolves normally and cannot be stopped by Sunken Treasure.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        What happens when there are two Corrupts in play? When the first creature is played, does the second Corrupt activate for the same creature, or do they each trigger separately when different creatures are played?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When a creature is played, both Corrupts trigger simultaneously. They then resolve in player order, meaning the creature becomes Core and changes control to each player in turn, one after another. The final controller of the creature will be the last player in player order who resolves their Corrupt effect. As a result, one creature can end up affected by multiple Corrupts if they are all resolved before it leaves play.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Spells, Powers, and Effects do not reduce energy loss. What does that specifically apply to? I thought that it refers to energy loss on the Magi; thinking that Collar of Dispair for instance wouldn't affect the magi if the sword is used. Could someone clarify this for me? Examples are helpful.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Pretty much anything that would reduce energy loss. For example, the Invulnerability Effect ("X loses one less energy from attacks.") is a good example with regards to Creatures. Collar doesn't cause an energy loss, it simply reduces a number on the card (which is then used during the game to determine how much energy to add to the Magi).

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        After using Giant Parathin's Interchange power, if Vorga is defeated and Gar is the next undefeated Magi in my pile, how do I get to Gar?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When your current Magi is defeated and you go to get your next one, you reveal the next undefeated Magi in your stack. It doesn't matter if there is a Defeated one already in the way.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        When Dave plays an Eebit while having a Robe of Vines on the table and Eebit Brother has a Naroom Shadow Geyser in play, does the geyser or the robe effect resolve first?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When two or more effects are triggered at the same time, they are resolved in player order. The active player (Dave) resolves all his effects first, so he adds one energy from the Robe of Vines. Then, when the Eebit Brother resolves his effects, the Naroom Shadow Geyser causes the Eebit to lose two energy. The Eebit survives with just one energy remaining.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If a card allows you to play Brushfire from your discard pile once per turn, can you play multiple copies of Brushfire each turn if you have more than one in your discard pile?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, the ability says "once per turn" which limits you to playing only one Brushfire from your discard pile per turn, regardless of how many are in your discard pile.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Can I use multiple Brushfires in one turn if they are in my discard pile?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, you can only use one Brushfire per turn, even if multiple Brushfires are in your discard pile. Each Brushfire's effect says 'once per turn,' so the first time you play a Brushfire from your discard each turn is the only time you may do so.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If you play a Giant Parathin and then activate its power, does the next Magi get to play Creatures or is it stuck in the second Powers phase?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Even though you swap Magi, the order of your turn is not changed. If you are in the 2nd PSR step when you begin Interchange, you are still in the 2nd PSR step when it is finished.
      </div>

      <div class="clarification-question">
        Can a Deep Hyren discard itself in order to use its Power (Hurricane) if it has its Starting Energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If the Deep Hyren is at 7 energy, then after using Hurricane it will still be around with 1 energy and can be discarded. However, if it is at 6 energy, it will be immediately discarded when paying the energy cost for its Power.
      </div>

      <div class="clarification-question">
        If I play Solar Flare twice on my turn, would all my surviving Arderial creatures that attacked and defeated an opposing creature get 8 energy instead of only 4 energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes. Quite a power play if you can get the situation to come up right.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        Does Burrowed count if used on Crystal Parmalag?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Burrow does not work to reduce the energy loss of Crystal Parmalag. While Burrow prevents more than two energy from being lost per turn, Crystal Parmalag's ability specifically prevents any spells, powers, or effects from preventing it from losing energy, which overrides Burrow's effect.

        If you use a Belt on a card with an ongoing effect like Shadow Cloak, does the effect get canceled?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No. The Belt prevents future uses of whatever you Lockdown. Anything already activated does not get 'turned off.'

        Can I use Eyes of Arderial to name Gilded Cage and prevent its discard effect?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, you cannot use Eyes of Arderial to prevent Gilded Cage's discard effect because the effect is not part of the spell being played—it is an alternative text or activated effect that triggers when the ability resolves, not during casting. Eyes of Arderial only prevents spells from being cast, so it does not apply to effects like Gilded Cage's.

        When you run out of cards in your library, when exactly do you shuffle your discard pile and make it your library? Can your discard pile be "recycled" more than once a turn?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Your discard pile can only be shuffled into your deck during your Draw Step, when you would draw a card and cannot because your deck is empty. And this recirculation can only happen once per Draw Step.

Add one energy to each Core and Bograth Creature and Magi in play.'). By my literal interpretation, the spell does not remove energy from my creatures/magi or Arderial's creatures/magi because it would remove energy from my magi (assuming I had energy on my Magi), since the text says 'discards no energy'. Is this a correct interpretation? The same applies if a Deep Hyren uses Hurricane, a Core Grag detonates, etc.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        OFFICIAL CLARIFICATION. Treat Uwamar Beads as if it says '...discards no energy from your Magi.' This is how Uwamar Beads is meant to operate (yes that infamous designer intent rears its ugly head again).

        Has there been any reversal of, or thoughts of reversing, the ruling about defensive effects triggering an additional time when an attack is redirected (e.g., Bo'Ahsa)?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, there has been no reversal or change to the ruling. When an attack is redirected, defensive effects can trigger again, as seen with Bo'Ahsa redirecting to Speag, allowing Speag's ability to activate twice and benefiting from Zassyfer's effect both times. This is part of Weave's strength—being attacked triggers powerful interactions.

        How does Kesia work with Mantle of Shadow?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Mantle of Shadow allows any magi to play Core spells, but Kesia's ability specifically restricts her from playing non-Weave spells. Since Kesia's restriction is self-referential and more specific than Mantle of Shadow's general allowance, Kesia cannot play non-Core spells.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Is the Specificity argument valid for resolving conflicts between card effects like Mantle and Kesia's restriction?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Specificity argument is problematic and overly complex. While both Cloak and Kesia impose restrictions on who can play what, Mantle creates a specific exception allowing Kesia to play Core region spells despite her general restriction against non-Weave regions. Stealth is generally available to Weave magi but specifically restricted for Kesia, making it less specific than the Mantle's targeted exception. The intent behind Mantle is explicitly to override Kesia’s limitation, suggesting that a more straightforward resolution—such as treating Mantle as an overriding effect rather than relying on specificity—is preferable. Given the ongoing confusion and pain caused by this argument, especially in cases like Hrada Lock, it is recommended to abandon the Specificity vs. General framework entirely and seek alternative rule mechanisms.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Xamf's effect does not trigger. Xamf's ability checks whether your smallest creature is larger than your opponent's largest creature. If you have no creatures in play, you do not have a smallest creature, so the condition cannot be evaluated as true. Even though you technically 'have more creatures' than your opponent (who has none), the effect specifically requires that you have at least one creature to compare sizes. Therefore, with no creatures, the condition fails and the ability does not trigger.

        When using Koll's Dream Twist ability to bring in a creature, does the player need to pay the creature's starting energy cost?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You do not need to pay the energy cost of bringing in the new creature via Koll; it is already 'subsumed' in the process of paying for the Power and discarding of another creature in the first place. Generally speaking, the default assumption for not-specified cards like this is that if an energy cost is not specified when playing a card in some alternate fashion, then there is no energy cost.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Colossus and Crystal Parmalag remain in play because they are protected against specific creature discards. Deep Wellisk also remains in play because it resists being specifically discarded from play, though it does not have the Anti-Magic effect as a named ability.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The term "restore" is considered energy addition if the total energy change is higher than the original amount of energy on the card, and energy removal if going down. Effects which are triggered upon adding or losing energy would be activated, as appropriate. If a creature is at the same energy level it was before the Restore, then it is considered neither addition nor subtraction, and no effects activate as a result.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If you Interchange, then by definition you were not able to "choose a number" at the beginning of that turn (since Elios wasn't out at the time). Thus, when the time comes to draw cards, you just draw your normal two cards. If you play Flood of Energy, you energize at whatever your Magi's energize rate is at the time. So, yes, if you Interchange into Elios, his Energize Rate for the remainder of the turn is still 8, since you didn't adjust it at the beginning of the turn.

        How does Kybar's Echo interact with discarding effects?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Kybar's Echo is a replacement effect: when one of your Kybar's Teeth creatures would be discarded, it is instead returned to your hand and never enters the discard pile. This means it does not count as being 'discarded' for triggering other card effects, though it can still trigger return-to-hand effects like Motash's Staff.

        Yes, despite the MRP (Master Rulebook Principle) for Tranquility, Resonate can still be played in discard energy mode, even though it won't actually discard energy.

        The power still happens normally; if the power affects the now-discarded creature (such as a Xyx Minor trying to use Gathering Clouds on itself with only two energy), then the power will still happen, it just will not be able to show any result. If that same Xyx Minor spent all of its energy to use Gathering Clouds on a different Xyx, then the surviving Xyx would receive the four energy, regardless of the creature using the power being discarded.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">

        Can Wiep use his Power - Power Drain:(2) Choose any Power on an opposing creature. Move energy equal to the cost of the chosen Power from that creature to Wiep, on my Gorath, naming the cost of (x) as 8?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Enslavement has no cost associated with it; when you use it, you choose an energy total and discard that much from Gorath, then gain control of a Creature with energy less than what you just discarded. Power Drain would move nothing from Gorath. Furthermore, any X is treated as zero except in the context of playing the card or using the ability with the X cost.

        If the Tomes are Cleansed, can Shadow Naroom play them despite the text 'only Naroom and Shadow Naroom may play Tomes'?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Shadow Naroom can still play the Tomes even if they are Cleansed, because the reminder text grants the ability to play the card specifically to Naroom and Shadow Naroom Magi. This is consistent with how abilities work on other cards like Crushing Roots, which also specifies 'only Naroom Magi and Naroom Shadow Magi may play' it, allowing Shadow Naroom to play it even when Cleansed. Similarly, if a Core or Bograth card were Cleansed to Underneath, only Core and Bograth Magi could play it—Underneath Magi would not be able to play the Cleansed card due to the specific restriction.

        Quido Swarm may be played with no creatures on the table; it will immediately discard itself for having no energy.

        Do the additional cards drawn to reach a hand size of five at the beginning of the game count as 'drawing' cards for the purposes of in-game effects?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The cards that a player draws to get a hand of five at the beginning of their first turn do not count as drawing cards for the purposes of in-game effects. For instance, if a player started with Marella as their first Magi, they would still receive any one Weave Creature and then draw four cards, as well as drawing one card at the end of her turn. Similarly, if there were some way to give a player who has not started their turn a Creature, and you had a Darkbreed's Minion in play, their Creature would not lose energy from Smolder. In your example, the Mydra Swarm would only stop them from drawing cards with card effects and the two cards at the end of their first turn.

        Can a spell be played for zero mana cost to trigger effects that depend on discarding energy, even if no actual energy is discarded?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        It is legal to play a card with an X cost where X equals 0, whether by choice or due to game effects. However, discarding zero energy does not count as an actual energy discard for triggering effects that require an amount of energy to be discarded. Since 'zero' means 'lacking an amount,' it does not satisfy conditions requiring a non-zero energy discard. This is why playing a spell like Quido Swarm for zero mana to remove Corrupt is allowed, but using such a play to trigger effects based on discarding energy (e.g., Charm) is not valid.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If a card discards energy, and there are other effects in play that prevent any form of energy discard prevention, then the energy discard will happen even if the target creature could normally not be affected by anything; however, other effects of the card will still be prevented. For example, if a Koil protected by Shadow Cloak takes damage from Firefly Swarm while Rayje's Sword is in play, the Koil loses two energy but remains protected from the secondary effect of Firefly Swarm and can still attack on your next turn.

        Resilience prevents any excess energy discard that would reduce Olabra's creatures below one energy. If the energy removal cannot be prevented, Resilience has no effect.

        Pyromancy only increases the amount of energy discarded; Syphon Vortex's 'move' is shorthand for 'discard X energy from an opposing Creature and add X energy to your Magi'.

        Bog Stench and Imaginary Friends do not create 'pseudo-Creatures'; they increase the effects of cards that count your Bograth Creatures or just your Creatures in play by letting you 'count as' having that many additional Bograth Creatures in play.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When the Yajo is attacked, its Weave ability triggers and may transfer one energy to or from another Weave Creature in play. However, when the Yajo is swapped with the Chasm Jile, the Chasm Jile does not have Weave, so no energy can be transferred. That said, if the new defender has Weave, then Weave would trigger on that creature as well. Additionally, any other effects triggered by a creature being attacked (such as Speag) will trigger both times—once for the original attack and once when the new target is attacked.

        Yes, Flame Trulb counts itself; its effect does not trigger until it is actually in play, and Familiarity does not specify 'other' Bograth and Cald creatures in play.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, the effects stack because they are described as direct additions or subtractions to the actual energize rate. Grand Epik's Mind Feast reduces your magi's energize by two, and Akkar's Rolling Thunder increases it by two when your opponent has more creatures out than you. If both effects apply simultaneously, they can increase or decrease the energize rate by up to six or more points depending on how many copies are in play. However, if multiple cards grant 'ENERGIZE:1', the result is still only ENERGIZE:1 unless the card already had a higher energize rate, as cards always use their highest energize rate.

        If I have a Hurricane Orish in play with Voice of the Storm, and I play another Hurricane Orish, does it come in for two less energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Hurricane Orish in play, being both Orothe and Arderial, will decrease the cost of your Arderial and your Orothe Creatures played. When you play another Hurricane Orish, because it is an Orothe Creature, it will cost one less, and because it is an Arderial Creature, it will cost an additional one less, therefore, the end result is that it costs two less energy to play.

        If I have a Grim Goblet in play and use Rayje's Belt lockdown to cancel the backlash effect to prevent my hand from discarding, and then Beam of Light is used to discard both relics at the same time, do I have to discard my hand because the lockdown power loses its effect or not? And what about if I have an Abranix Crown in my hand—will it take effect or not?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Lockdown will end when the Belt leaves play; similarly, any continuous effects of a Power do not end until the card(s) targeted by Beam of Light are successfully discarded from play. The Grim Goblet has also already been discarded, and you will not suffer the Backlash. If you do suffer from Backlash and are forced to discard an Abraxin's Crown, its discard effect will not trigger; it must be discarded from your hand by an opposing card to do so, even if an opposing card forced you to discard the Goblet and triggered Backlash.

        Your 15 energy Wudge would only remove one energy if an Elder Yark were present because Rayje's Sword does not go into effect; any card that causes a creature to remove its starting energy instead of its current energy during an attack is not considered to be preventing energy loss.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Each time you play a new Pyder, you transfer all but one energy your Magi currently has to it. Whenever you play a Creature, each Pyder's Summoning will trigger. As the active player, you choose the order they resolve in. You must choose a Pyder that has enough energy to play the Creature to resolve first, or you cannot play the Creature. The rest of your Pyder's Summonings will resolve, and you will discard energy from them equal to how much energy is necessary to pay the cost of the Creature played, which is now zero. When your Magi energizes, all of your Pyders' Leaderships will trigger. You choose which resolves first, and that Pyder receives all of the extra energy beyond one of the Magi. The rest of your Pyders will receive zero energy, since your Magi does not have any amount over one any longer.

        No; the text on cards happens in the order that the text is written, unless the card itself states an exception.

        When Sheath says it prevents a creature from using an effect, does it shut off effects like "Burrow"? Or does this simply mean one-time use effects?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Sheath prevents the Creature it is printed on from using any Effects that are part of its own abilities. If a Creature such as Pylofuf is Sheathed, then it loses the ability to use Burrow, and its burrow status is removed since it is granted by an Effect on the Creature. However, if a Creature like Korrit has had a nine-turn Burrow Spell cast on it, Sheathing it does not remove its burrowed status because the Burrow effect comes from a separate spell, not from the Creature's own Effects. Similarly, if a Tunnel Hyren is Sheathed, its Burrow ability stops, but an Underneath Creature that becomes Sheathed while a Tunnel Hyren is in play will still retain its burrowed benefit as long as the Hyren remains in play and can use its Effect.

        No, Rayje was not intended to function that way. He can only gain one copy of any Power or Effect, regardless of how many copies of himself are in play.

        If I have a Pylofuf in play with 7 energy, and it is attacked by an opposing Shielded Parmalag with 2 energy on it with a 4 energy Giant Korrit joining in the attack, what amount of energy is removed from the Pylofuf? Does the Pack Hunt Effect remove extra damage from the Pylofuf, or does the Effect Enable an Attack which does not allow for more than 2 energy to be removed this turn?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Pylofuf takes 4 energy damage. The Pack Hunt effect allows multiple attackers to attack together, but it doesn't limit total damage taken—only that each attacker can only deal up to 2 energy of damage per turn unless otherwise specified. Since the Giant Korrit has 4 energy and is attacking, it deals its full 4 energy in damage. The Shielded Parmalag contributes 2 energy, but the Pylofuf’s ability does not reduce damage from multiple attackers. Therefore, a total of 6 energy is dealt (2 from the Parmalag + 4 from the Giant Korrit), and since Pylofuf has 7 energy, it loses 6 energy. The Pack Hunt effect enables the combined attack but does not restrict the total damage or reduce extra damage beyond what’s specified.

        My opponent has Emlob as his Magi with one energy and no creatures in play. He casts Trulb Horde, bringing his Magi to 0 energy, but as the spell resolves, a 1 Energy creature is coming into play. Is Emlob defeated before the creature comes into play since he has no energy and no creatures, or is the Magi not checked for defeat until after any given spell resolves?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Emlob is not defeated before the creature comes into play. The Magi is only checked for defeat after a spell fully resolves. Since Trulb Horde's effect causes a 1 Energy creature to enter play as part of resolving, Emlob remains in play because the creature enters before any check for defeat occurs.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Magi does not get defeated during the resolution of the spell. The condition for defeat occurs only when the spell finishes resolving and there are no creatures in play. Since a creature is brought into play after the spell resolves, the Magi remains in play. Emlob would also be able to use this effect while the spell is resolving because he is considered to have 3 extra Bograth creatures at that time, satisfying any relevant conditions.

        Overwriting Wind Spawn does not simply allow Kalius to play Core Creatures; it would have to say "play a Core Creature ignoring regional restrictions" if that were the case.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        As with any other 'any' starting card specification, you must search the discard pile first for any cards that fit the 'any' specification.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No. Due to changes made during playtesting, Syphon Vortex no longer allows cards to add energy to Tryn. If she uses Syphon Vortex, she spends X + 4 energy and gains nothing back; her Energy Substitution effect converts the discarded energy into gained energy, but this does not apply in a way that enables infinite or excessive energy gain. The ability to channel all energy into a substituted Syphon Vortex and then use Updraft to create an extreme energy advantage was one of the reasons this change was implemented.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        From now on, cards will explicitly state whether you pay the costs when they enter play through alternate means. The Tomes were an oversight due to insufficient playtesting revisions; their wording did not align with current templating standards.

        I target a Treepsh with a Crushing X spell. The Treepsh pops itself to cancel its own energy loss. Do the secondary effects of the Crushing X spell still occur?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, the secondary effects of the Crushing Spell will not happen because the Treepsh being discarded from play was not a direct result of the Crushing card discarding its energy.

        I am playing Paradwyn with Bazha's Pendant in play, which lets me use powers in response to an opponent playing powers, spells, or relics. My opponent casts a Crushing X spell on my Lahalou, which is at 4E. Can I use Lahalou's power to grow by one before the resolution of the spell so that it will survive?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, the Spell or Power will resolve before you can activate the Pendant's effect; 'after' the opponent uses a Spell or Power means when it has successfully resolved. The Lahalou would be discarded before it could use its power.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The phrase "the Spell, Power, or Effect does nothing" is another way of saying "prevent all results of the Spell, Power, or Effect." Piercing will still allow any energy discard to happen, because that cannot be prevented while it is in effect.

        If a creature has multiple regions, such as Weave/Naroom, and a spell affects all non-Weave creatures, does the creature's Weave region protect it, or is it affected because of its Naroom region?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        A creature with multiple regions is considered to be a creature of every region listed. Therefore, if a card affects all non-Weave creatures, a Weave/Naroom creature is unaffected because it is a Weave creature—having one region that matches Weave means it does not qualify as 'non-Weave.' The term 'non-Weave' refers to creatures that lack the Weave region entirely.

        If a Zannah's creature is stalked and then attacked, does the damage from stalking get negated by burrowing or other effects, and how does the source of the damage affect this?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When Zannah's Charm has not been activated previously and one of her stalked creatures is attacked, the one energy lost to stalking is prevented by Charm. The damage from stalking comes from a rule (not a spell, power, or effect), so it bypasses effects like burrowing. However, since the source of the damage is the attacking creature, any abilities that negate damage based on source will apply—meaning if the attacker has an ability that negates damage from its own attacks, it could prevent this damage.

        Does the word "Immediately" in Wellisk's effect mean it resolves before any other effects, or does it work like standard triggered effects?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The word "immediately" means you must choose to use Dream Barrier as soon as possible, before the opponent can perform any other non-triggered actions on their turn, but after the Creature is successfully played; any other Effects triggered simultaneously do 'stack' alongside it and resolve normally. Wellisk uses the wording 'immediately after' instead of 'as another Creature is played' so that the Creature played will get an opportunity to enter play and trigger any related Effects, as well as trigger similar Effects for leaving play. For example, if the opponent has a Wudge in play and you have a Wellisk, and they spend five energy to play a Chaos Plith, when Chaos Plith enters play, both Strengthen and Dream Barrier are triggered; Strengthen resolves first because the opponent is the active player, giving Wudge +1 energy, and then you choose whether or not to discard the Wellisk and use the rest of Dream Barrier's effect to discard the Chaos Plith from play. If the opponent had a Corrupted Sphor taken from you, the Chaos Plith being discarded by Dream Barrier would also trigger Scavenge. The word 'immediately' serves no functional purpose other than to emphasize that you must decide whether or not to use the rest of Dream Barrier then, before anything else aside from a simultaneously triggered Effect can be played/used.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Ullig will not gain 4 energy in this case because the creature did not leave play through a discard mechanic. She would be instantly defeated if she has no energy and no Dewstone in play, as returning a creature to hand does not trigger Fearless. The ability only activates when a creature is discarded from play by a discard effect or reduced to zero energy and removed from play.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, the Power still works normally. If the Power affects the creature after it has been discarded due to depleted energy (such as Xyx Minor using Gathering Clouds on itself with only two energy), the effect still occurs, though it cannot produce any visible result. For example, if a Xyx Minor spends all its energy to use Gathering Clouds on another Xyx, the surviving Xyx will receive four energy regardless of the original creature being discarded.

        With Siphon Vortex, do you gain the energy that is removed from the target Creature, or does it depend on damage dealt?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Siphon Vortex's most recent wording states 'move X energy from an opposing Creature to your Magi'. This is a move/transfer effect where both discarding the energy and gaining it are dependent on each other. If the energy loss is prevented (e.g., by Fird Stone), then no energy is gained. Similarly, if the amount of discarded energy changes due to effects like Scroll of Fire, the same amount is added to your Magi.

        Yes, as long as all conditions are met, you may activate any number of applicable cards. When an opponent plays a Spell or Power, you can activate not only one copy of Bahza's Pendant but also play every Bloom in hand that qualifies. This creates a chain of reactions—similarly, playing a Creature triggers each Reef Hyren's Rebuke in play, allowing multiple uses as long as the triggering conditions are satisfied.

        When does Stalking damage occur relative to other effects like Weave?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Both Stalking and Weave are triggered by a creature being attacked. The active player’s effects resolve first. Therefore, if you attack during your turn, Weave resolves before Stalking, allowing the creature to transfer energy before losing it. However, if you attack an opponent's creature on their turn, they are the active player, so their Weave effect would resolve first (if applicable), followed by the Stalking damage.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You may use Dreamwarp to increase or decrease the starting energy value of the N'Kala creatures until the end of the turn, but they will still only have one energy because Waking Dreams specifically states that the creatures played by it have one energy instead of their normal starting energy.

        Can someone explain the second regions on Nightmare's Dawn cards?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When a card has a second region, it functions exactly the same as a single region card of both different regions within the context of the rules. For a Creature, this means Magi of either region may play the Creature without paying regional penalties. For a Relic, this means a Magi of either region can play it. For Magi, it means they can play cards of either of their regions without penalty or restriction. Additionally, when a card effect refers to a card type of either region on a multi-region card matching the named card type, then it affects that card normally. For instance, a Cald/Weave Creature cannot be affected by a Firefly Swarm, as Firefly Swarm cannot affect Cald Creatures. Conversely, an Arderial/Naroom Creature could be affected by Call of the Wild on Essence of Naroom since it is a Naroom Creature. One last note regarding Braggle and multi-region Creatures; if either of the two regions on a Creature involved in combat with the Braggle match Braggle's region, then its Effect will prevent combat damage as normal.

        If I have a corrupted Pylofuf and I place Agram's Armor on it, does it lose no energy in attacks? Because Pylofuf says it may only lose two energy in attacks and spells per turn, and Agram's Armor says the chosen creature loses 2 less. So if it loses 2 and then 2 less, does that mean it loses no energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Effects that alter the amount of energy being lost are always applied before those that limit the energy loss. The same goes for things that alter card costs and those that halve or limit the costs of the cards. Therefore, the amount of energy assigned to be removed in the attack by the opposing creature will be reduced by two because of the Armor, then the amount left will be reduced to a maximum of two by Burrow.

        Does Gwaeg return to your hand if a spell, power, or effect discards it? What if I discard it to use the Moob ring? Some people in my area say the text on Gwaeg means that the Creature only returns to your hand when it is attacked.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When a card refers to a Creature having to be 'defeated while defending', then it means the Creature must be attacked and reduced to zero energy at any time during the attack. If a one-energy Gwaeg were attacked by a Lahalou with three energy, then when both Creatures remove energy from each other normally, the Gwaeg would be defeated while defending, and return to its owner's hand. If the same example happened and the Gwaeg was stalked, making it lose its one energy before energy is normally discarded, it would be defeated while defending (because the definition of defeat is simply to be reduced to zero energy), and would return to its owner's hand. However, if the Gwaeg was attacked and you chose to discard it to fulfill another card effect—such as a card that said 'Effect - You're Mean: When one of your Bograth Creatures is attacked, you may discard it from play before energy is removed to make the attacking player feel bad'—then it would not be 'defeated while defending', because it was discarded directly from play and was not reduced to zero energy, and it would stay in the discard pile.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If Amanax were to use Syphon Vortex on a Creature with six energy, spending ten energy for the X portion of the Vortex's cost, he would gain twelve energy, because he can only move six from the Creature to himself, and then he would only gain the six energy discarded by the Spell with his Effect.

        Syphon Vortex vs. Rock Hyren: Rock Hyren has 11e and his Effect Invulnerability: Lose 2 less Energy from Spells. Can SV be cast for 17e, X being 13 to kill the Rock Hyren, or is X limited to the amount of energy on the Creature? And how much energy does the Magi get back, the 11 or 13e?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You can make X as high as you can afford, and the Syphon Vortex will attempt to discard X energy, adding back an amount to your Magi equal to what was actually discarded. Invulnerability will stop the first two 'points' of the Vortex, then the excess will get through. If it is enough to discard the Hyren, then it will do so, and the Magi will receive an amount of energy equal to how much was actually discarded. In the example given, the Hyren would be discarded, and the Magi would regain eleven energy.

        Kyg'n is defeated immediately when a Creature is declared to attack him, before any other effects are triggered.

The Hinko kills the Eebit and gains 2 energy from the two Taunts. Does this trigger each Flying Hinko's Empower effect twice (once per Taunt), giving me 4 energy for my Magi? And does the same happen when the second Hinko attacks, resulting in another 4 energy for my Magi?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Whenever one of your Creatures is attacking and survives the attack, each Taunt you have used on a Sabertooth Jumbor that turn will add one energy to the Creature. In your example, each Flying Hinko will gain two energy after defeating the Eebits. Taunt is a Naroom Power, and when it adds energy to a Creature, it will trigger each Flying Hinko's Empower. Empower will give four energy after each of the attacks in the example given: First Taunt - +1 to Magi with Empower; Second Taunt - +1 to Magi with Empower; Two Empowers - x2 gain.

        Does Krawg's immunity protect it from losing energy due to being Stalked by Jungle Jiles, and if a Carillion attacks a 2e Krawg with Trample, does Krawg avoid damage from Trample?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Being 'stalked' is a condition generated by a game mechanic; it does not discard energy as a Spell, Power, or Effect, but by the Creature attacking the stalked Creature. Krawg will lose the energy from being Stalked normally. If an Effect discards additional energy based on the Creature being stalked, then that extra energy discard would not happen. Trample does not affect Krawg—it affects the Carillion—so the Carillion would still lose no energy.

        When you play an Alpine Xamf, does it gain the benefit of its own effect and does it gain 2 energy for being both a Kybar's Teeth and a Naroom creature?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Whenever you play a card, the 'whenever you play' effect triggers at the moment the card leaves your hand and is scheduled to enter the playing field. By that time, the Alpine Xamf has already been played, so its own effect does not activate for itself. However, once it successfully enters play, all effects on the card become active, including 'when this creature enters play' effects. Since Flame Trulb must be in play before its effect triggers and counts itself as a creature, the Alpine Xamf cannot gain energy from itself at entry—but if Flame Trulb is already in play, it can count the Xamf as a creature for triggering effects.

        When you take control of a Corathan using Turn, River Abiquist, Crushing Darkness, or similar means, does its effect trigger so you can search your own discard pile for a Core or Orothe card and place it in your hand?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, the effect does not trigger when you take control of Corathan. You gain control of the creature immediately after the theft resolves, but the effect is tied to the original controller’s action. Since the card wasn’t stolen by the player who now controls it during their turn (or under conditions that would allow triggering), the effect doesn't activate for them. This is consistent with how Morag using Theft on a Karak Band would gain no energy—control transfer does not trigger effects based on theft unless explicitly tied to the controller’s actions.

        No, you do not draw 2 cards or gain 2 energy when taking control of a Karak Necklace or Band. The effect triggers only if the card is stolen by the player who gains control during their turn and under conditions that satisfy the theft bonus. Since gaining control through means like Hubdra's Cube or Crushing Surf does not count as an act of 'theft' for triggering such effects, the benefit does not apply to you—similar to how Morag would gain no energy from stealing a Karak Band with Theft.

        No; though you are playing a card someone else owns, it is entering play under your control.

        If Tryn Flamesaver follows the Dark Twins, she becomes a Naroom Shadow Magi but loses her Cald status. The Dark Twins specifically cause the Magi to become only a Naroom Shadow Magi, so the limitations of being a Shadow Magi take precedence and she cannot play non-core cards.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Climbing Staff cannot stop any part of the Vaporize spell. Vaporize affects both the Magi and their Relics, not just the Magi, so it does not qualify as a spell that solely affects a Magi or a player's hand. Therefore, Climbing Staff has no effect on Vaporize.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Because Climbing Staff gives the broad range of "whenever", if an active continuous Effect is affecting only your Magi, then as long as the Effect is active there is no moment in time that you cannot discard a Climbing Staff from your hand or from play, with the exception of when it is being discarded by something else. In the situation you mentioned, the very last moment you could discard it would be when the Spell is played, but before it resolves. Once it starts resolving, the hands are revealed and then the Relics (or Spells) are discarded without a "pause" to throw the Staff away and shut down Sorreah.

        Can a Magi grab an alternate version of a card listed in their starting cards?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        An Alternate of a card is considered that card for the purposes of game rules. You can only have three copies of a card in your deck, so you cannot include both regular and alternate versions if they exceed this limit. For example, you could not play three Furoks and three Dark Furoks. A Magi who starts with an alternate version (like Evil Evu starting with Dark Furok) can still start with the original card (e.g., a normal Furok). Similarly, since cards listed under 'STARTING: xxxx Magi' are treated as if they were printed on that Magi, any alternate version of such a card is also available as a starting card. For example, Krawg has 'STARTING: Ashgar', and because 'Good Ol' Ashgar' is an alternate version of Ashgar, either Magi can start with Krawg or its alternate version if one exists. Likewise, if 'Any Cald Magi' were added to Ash Hyren's starting cards, any Cald Magi could begin with either Ash Hyren or Darkbreed's Minion.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Stealth still works because it does not reduce energy loss; instead, it allows your creature to remove energy from the opposing creature before they can remove energy from your creature. Although the amount of energy removed is lower, no energy loss reduction occurs within the rules context.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Rayje's Sword's Piercing ability prevents any Spell, Power, or Effect—named or not—from reducing energy loss. If a Spell, Power, or Effect indirectly causes reduced energy loss (such as granting a burrowed status that limits energy loss), Piercing allows the full energy loss to occur unaltered. However, if the reduction in energy loss comes from a game mechanic inherent to a card's text (like being buried by a card effect not explicitly tied to a Spell or Power), then Piercing does not apply.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Piercing allows a Spell, Power, or Effect to discard energy normally even if it would otherwise be prevented by an effect like Protection, Resistance, or another similar ability. However, only the energy discarding portion is allowed; any other effects of the Spell, Power, or Effect are still prevented by the original immunity.

        Does Piercing prevent a replacement effect that reduces the amount of energy discarded during an attack?

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Piercing does not affect replacement effects that set the amount of energy to be discarded to a fixed value less than what the creature would normally discard. Such effects are not considered energy loss prevention, so Piercing cannot stop them. For example, Regal Presence on Elder Yark replaces the energy discarded during an attack with either the attacker's starting or current energy, whichever is lower. This is a replacement effect, not damage reduction, so Piercing does not prevent it.

        No, Piercing does not circumvent restrictions that prevent using Spells, Powers, or Effects that discard energy. If a card cannot be used at all due to such a restriction, like being Lockdown by Rayje's Belt, then Piercing has no effect and the energy cannot be discarded as intended.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Piercing does not prevent a player from using a Spell, Power, or Effect that reduces energy loss; instead, it negates the effect of that reduction. For example, if a creature like Pylofuf uses its Burrow ability to reduce energy loss during an attack, and the attacking player has Rayje's Sword in play with Piercing, then Burrow’s energy loss reduction will have no effect—though the ability can still be used. This is because Piercing stops the energy loss reduction portion of the effect, not the use of the ability itself.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The ability for you to be protected from not being able to use Powers, Effects, etc., is caused by an Effect on the Cloak.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If you have let your opponent get to the point where they are choosing what the Beam of Light is affecting, then it is too late to use Time Lapse. Time Lapse states 'whenever an opponent plays a card you may discard Phrup from play.' This means when they actually play it but before any choices are made, such as playing the Beam of Light, but before they choose two Phrups. If they did not pause to give you an opportunity to Time Lapse the Beam, declaring they would use it on the two Phrups before you had the chance to say you were Time Lapsing it, then you may force them to allow you to use Time Lapse, even with the knowledge of what they intended. But if they have given you the opportunity to use Time Lapse, you declined, and then they decided to affect one of your Phrups, it is too late to decide and use Time Lapse.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        As soon as the Granas is declared as attacking the Elder Yark, the following trigger occurs: Sneak Attack - Attacker (Attacking Player), Sneak Attack - Defender (Attacking Player), Motivate (Defending Player), Demotivate (Defending Player), Regal Presence (Defending Player). The attacking player, as the active player, resolves their effects first and chooses whether to make the attacker or defender discard starting energy instead of current energy. Then, the defending player, as the inactive player, resolves their own effects and decides whether to Motivate or Demotivate, and when to resolve Regal Presence. If Regal Presence is resolved before Demotivate, Demotivate can still be used to revert the amount discarded back to starting energy if desired by the defender. Ultimately, the defending player has final control over the outcome. Additionally, Pummel increases the amount of energy the Granas discards by one.

        No, Firefly Swarm cannot target a Lovian even with a Sword of Light in play. The Lovian's ability prevents non-Arderial spells from affecting him, and this targeting restriction cannot be overridden by the Sword of Light. According to Magi-Nation's effects-based ruling system, you cannot play a spell that has no legal targets or would have no effect—since Firefly Swarm cannot affect the Lovian due to his immunity, it cannot be played against him.

        The phrase "restore a Creature to its starting energy" is shorthand for "set the chosen Creature's energy at its starting energy."

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When a creature attacks a stalked creature, the energy removal comes from the attacking creature and is discarded by a game mechanic, not a spell, power, effect, or attack. This makes stalking unique and difficult to counter once a creature is stalked. The source of the 'stalked' condition can come from a spell, power, or effect, but if an opposing effect tries to give Krawg the 'stalked' condition, Krawg will not become stalked. Burrow is attached to the spell, power, or effect that grants it, but 'stalked' is a uniquely different mechanic, with energy removal tied to the attacking creature, not any other source.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        If I cast a Mydra Swarm on my opponent: Can he play a Vellup or Elder Vellup to get a card from his draw deck? Can he steal one of my creatures and get a card from his discard pile from a Corathan? Can he attack me and have his Twee defeated to draw the top card of his discard pile? All three of these situations have the opponent drawing cards. I am fairly sure that the Mydra Swarm would not stop effects and powers like O'qua's conjure and Blygt's waking dreams because the cards are going from the deck or discard pile directly to play. What is the definition of drawing a card? If it is adding a card not in play to your hand, I would say the previous three should not work under a Mydra Swarm, hence my ruling question. The word "draw" ruling would be more rules lawyerish (read like M:tG), and drawing a card makes more logical sense since that is what it actually says. In summary, does it only stop cards that specifically have the word "draw" in them, or any card that lets you draw cards?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Mydra Swarm and Drawing Cards - None of the Effects you referenced are card drawing, they are card retrieval. Just as Mydra Swarm cannot prevent the retrieval of starting cards, the ability to retrieve cards from the discard pile or deck is left intact.

        Does Corathan's Betrayal only trigger when I gain control of an opposing card already in play, or whenever I gain control of an opposing card? If I cast a Crushing Darkness, can I get a card from my discard pile?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Corathan's Betrayal triggers only when you gain control of an opposing card that is already in play. When you cast Crushing Darkness and then replay the creature, you do not gain control of the card at any point—its owner remains the same, so Corathan's effect is not triggered.

        Yes, if Crushing Darkness triggers Betrayal, you can retrieve it, provided it has already been discarded and is in the discard pile.

        I have a 7 energy Bagala Hunter that attacks a Stalked 5 energy Pylofuf. Does the Pylofuf lose 3 or 2 energy? I figure since it is a Mechanic the answer is three. Would it matter if it was Gyrg's Pylofuf that was stalked/would it still lose three? Does the mechanic of "stalk" take precedent or Digging Mastery? In this situation it would seem that Digging mastery caps the total damage from all sources at 2 during each attack.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Stalking Burrow - Energy removed by stalking happens during an attack, so it is counted in Gyrg's cap. Burrow will do nothing to prevent it, and so in your example the Pylofuf loses one energy from being stalked, then up to one more from the attack (thanks to Gyrg's cap).

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Rock Hyren would be defeated. Stalking discards one energy from the Hyren, then when energy is discarded, the seven energy discarded by the Bagala Hunter is reduced to six by Invulnerability, then the Hyren's remaining six is discarded and it is defeated.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, the Taglet will stay attached to the creature and function as if it were a Tar Hyren due to the copied Cling Effect until the beginning of your next turn. At that point, the Cling effect ends, leaving the Taglet as a Creature card with zero energy, which is immediately discarded. Although the Taglet remains a Creature card after losing Cling, it has no way to stay in play without energy, so it is discarded. This also means that if Cling were somehow locked down (e.g., by an effect preventing attachment), the Tar Hyren would be discarded from play—preventing situations where a creature with no energy could remain attached and potentially gain energy again.

        No, you cannot use Sorreah's Dream to discard energy from your opponent's Mushroom Hyren. When using Sorreah's Dream to copy a Power, the cost is paid by the Dream itself, not by the card with the Power.

        We were playtesting dual-region Magi long before Grej, Prek, and Evil Evu were released (as he could effectively be looked at as "Core/Naroom"). If they were intended to be truly dual-region, they would have been printed as such.

        Dream Twist would have to specify 'play a Kybar's Teeth Creature regardless of region' to allow a corrupted Koll to play it.

Koll could still play a creature from the region specified in Dream Twist, but only if that creature is playable by a Kybar's Teeth Shadow Magi.

        There appears to be a contradiction between two rules statements regarding 'move' effects: one says the discard and addition are dependent on each other, while another states they are not linked—specifically, that increasing the energy discarded does not increase the amount added. How should these be reconciled?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Cards that reduce the energy discard of a move effect reduce the amount of energy added by the move effect; however, cards that increase the energy discard do not increase the energy added.

        What is the correct way to interpret 'Move' effects in terms of energy transfer between sources?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Whenever a Spell, Power, or Effect requires you to move energy from one source to another, you discard the specified amount from the source being moved from and add that same amount to the destination source. Cards that increase the energy discarded do not increase the energy added; however, cards that reduce the energy discarded also reduce the energy added by a corresponding amount. This mechanic is based on real-life logic: if you move less than the full amount (e.g., a gallon minus a cup), you only add what was actually moved; similarly, if more is discarded due to effects, it doesn't result in extra energy being added—only the actual amount moved is transferred.

        Updraft returns the creature to the OWNER'S hand. The owner is the person who started the game with the card in their deck. When you Updraft a creature gained via Arosa's Shell Game, it will return to the original owner's hand. If Arosa is defeated while controlling a creature through Shell Game, the creature will return to Arosa's player side of the table when the duration of Shell Game ends, potentially creating a briefly orphaned creature that is not immune to spells, powers, effects, or attacks.

        Does the restriction 'Play only two cards per turn' on Korg and Zet mean they can only put down two cards from their hand, or does it also limit other actions like using powers or attacking?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When you 'play' a card it means taking it from an out of play area (hand, deck, or discard pile) and placing it onto the playing field. Using a Power or Effect on a card is not considered 'playing' a card. However, if a restriction limits how many cards you can play per turn and you use a Power or Effect to try to exceed that limit, the part of the Power or Effect that puts the card into play will fizzle. For example, Korg & Zet playing Entomb, naming Hyren's Call, then playing Hyren's Call reaches their two-card-per-turn limit; they can only look through their deck and shuffle it afterward, as no more cards can be played.

        The previous members of the Rules Team had the ability to make rulings independently without discussion, which led to inconsistencies in rare cases involving design versus intent conflicts.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If a card specifically changes the Energize rate, it alters the amount added by Focus. For example, if a Magi's base Energize rate is five and a Dream Channel increases it to seven, Focus would triple the modified rate, resulting in twenty-one.

        Does ENERGIZE: 1 count as 'gaining' one energy? My wife had a Jile in play with seventeen other Bograth slimeballs and I had a Jip. Do all creatures with ENERGIZE 'gain' that energy, making Jip the cutest, killiest, greeniest, deadliest little Naroomese sod-bird?

        When a card energizes, it isn't 'gaining energy' as far as the rules are concerned; Jip would gain nothing.

        If Baa is turned into a Shadow Magi by Hrada and can play cards from their original region with a regional penalty of one (two if Naroom), does playing Gwaeg, a Core/Bograth Dream Creature, require the regional penalty?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Baa must pay the regional penalty of one when playing Gwaeg. Although Gwaeg is a Core creature, it is still a Bograth card, and since Baa is a Shadow Magi who has been transformed from a Bograth Magi, they are restricted to casting cards from their original region with a regional penalty. Because Hrada specifies a 'regional penalty of one' rather than an increased cost, the penalty applies whenever a card is cast from outside the Magi's original region—regardless of whether it is also a Core creature. Thus, even though Gwaeg is Core, it remains out of region for Baa as a Bograth Shadow Magi, requiring the one-energy regional penalty.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        In a situation where a dual region card is involved and a restriction applies based on region (such as Rayje's Band preventing Non-Universal Magi from casting Non-Universal spells not of their region), does the card's status as both regions simultaneously allow it to bypass restrictions, or are restrictions applied based on one region over the other?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        In cases involving dual-region cards, they are equally both regions at the same time. Therefore, a player may cast a dual-region spell or creature if it matches either of its two regions, regardless of which region is being restricted. For example, Amanax can cast Brushfire (which is both Cald and Weave) because it is a valid Cald card, even though it is also a Weave creature; the restriction from Rayje's Band does not apply since the spell satisfies at least one of its regional requirements.

        A) Please, rules team, define regional restriction.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        A regional restriction means that your Magi is forbidden from playing cards of a certain type of a certain region because the Magi's region is different from the card to be played. The inability for Core Magi to play non-Core, non-Universal cards, as well as the inability for non-core Magi to play Core cards or non-Universal Relics not of their region, are regional restrictions.

        B) If Ulk cleansed Crushing Darkness, and then played one, as we all know she now can, can she still play the defeated creature, because Crushing Darkness states that the creature is played as a core creature? Underneath Magi cannot play core creatures without explicit text from the card. What's going on?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If the Magi could not play a Core Creature, then they would be unable to follow through with the second half of Crushing Darkness, and would get no Creature back. Exceptions would be if the Creature had the text "Underneath Magi may play xxxx", in the example you gave, or the corresponding region for your Magi.

        C) I disagree with rulings made previously about crushing spells and cards that allow you to ignore regional penalties and restrictions, such as Heart of the Sky, Hand, and Tomes of the GL. I personally feel that the sentence "Only Underneath Magi and Underneath Shadow Magi can play Crushing Fungus." is a regional restriction. Therefore, with Heart of the Sky, I would be able to play it, even though my Magi is Arderial, because I ignore regional restrictions. If this is not a regional restriction, than what is it?

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Against Shell, it works similarly as against Shadow Cloak; all energy discard of non-Orothe Spells and Powers gets through. Entangle is different because you cannot even attempt to play a Spell that would discard energy, so the Sword wouldn't 'know' energy removal is being reduced. Against Tranquility, energy is still discarded normally; all Tranquility does in this case is net a card draw.

        The problem with this case is, though both effects are triggered simultaneously, they both cannot actually be processed fully.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The intent is to apply when the effect of the card actually 'hits' the victim; this is similar to playing a Furok after an opponent has used Deadfall.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No; Swamp Hyren has a single cost reduction ability that applies to both Core and Bograth Creatures. Therefore, any creature that satisfies the condition would cost one less energy. In contrast, Voice of the Storm's Diplomacy Effect has two separate cost reduction effects in it, each with separate conditions. If both conditions are met, both reductions apply. In addition, Glablit only affects your Creature in play, not ones in the process of being played.

        Again, Blight has a single effect of adding energy to Creatures that fit either of the conditions listed. So, any Creature that fits either (or both) condition, will receive one energy.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Tranquility prevents the loss of Energy when playing Spells that discard Energy, not the declaration of those Spells. The original wording in the Cald/Arderial Demo decks clarified this by stating: 'Until the beginning of your next turn, all Spells that discard Energy instead discard no energy. Draw one additional card during your Draw Step.' This version makes it clear Tranquility reduces Energy loss, allowing effects like Rayje's Sword to still function.

        Can Tryn Flame Saver use Energy Substitution with Healing Flame to remove energy from a Naroom or Cald creature or Magi while under Abraxin's Crown?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes; Dreamburn allows Healing Flame to affect Cald or Naroom Magi, and then Energy Substitution changes "add" to "discard".

        With Tryn Flame Saver, Tap Roots in hand, and Abraxin's Crown in play, can I use Energy Substitution to remove energy from my opponent's Magi after using Tap Roots to remove 2 energy from two creatures?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No; Dreamburn only applies to the very first line on Tap Roots that lets you choose two Creatures; if you Dreamburn it to Magi, you must choose two Magi. You could still use Energy Substitution to discard two energy from both Magi or two Creatures.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes; there must be at least two Creatures in play to use Tap Roots, and the amount of energy added and discarded is independent. The term "up to" includes zero, so you could discard two energy from one creature and add zero to another.

        If Ballistic Baldar's ability requires me to choose 'up to' a number of creatures equal to the die roll, and I roll a 4 but my opponent only has two creatures in play, do I have to choose my own creatures to take the damage?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Ballistic Baldar actually says "equal to" not "up to." If you roll a number higher than the number of creatures your opponent has in play, you must choose your own creatures to discard energy from. However, if you roll a number higher than the total number of creatures in play (including yours), and there is no alternative effect such as discarding three energy from each creature in play instead, the ability cannot be fully resolved and thus fizzles, discarding nothing.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes. Whenever a card instructs you to "choose Y creatures" where Y is any number, it is implied that you must select exactly that many different creatures unless the card specifies otherwise (such as with Makoor). This means you may need to choose your own creatures if there aren't enough opponent creatures available, potentially causing effects like Swamp Weebo to backfire.

        Yes; if the opponent has no Creatures in play, when you use Treepsh's Power, as long as you had at least one other Creature in play, you would get the extra card.

        If Trygar is defeated simultaneously with an opponent using Sorreah or Rayje's Belt locking down his Avenger effect, does his Avenger ability still trigger?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        By the time the effect that prevents him from using Avenger leaves play, he will have left play also, if his defeat and the removing of the effect was simultaneous. Note that in cases where he defeats himself by playing a Spell, etc., and the Spell removes the preventative effect, then he is defeated by having no energy, he would get to use Avenger. For instance, if Trygar had two energy left and an opposing Rayje's Belt was Locking Down Avenger, he could spend his remaining energy to play Resonate, choosing to discard the Belt. When Resonate resolved, the Belt would be discarded. Then, immediately afterward, since there are no pending card effects and there is a Magi with no energy in play (Trygar), he will be defeated. In the momentary pause between the Belt leaving play and the rules realizing Trygar was defeated, he would have regained the ability to use Avenger.

        All results would be applied simultaneously; in the example stated, Resonate discards one energy from Dasia and two energy from the Magi simultaneously.

        Even though Shatterfire gives the opponent a choice of taking the energy loss, it is still energy being discarded from a Magi by one of your Powers (which Last Words prohibits); because of this, they could choose not to let the Relic be discarded, and then would lose no energy.

        Scyalla and Sarazen Outcast: Both of these cards allow you to name a creature type, how does this work? Does the terms like Elder, Giant, Guardian, Pup, Stone, Magam...etc. mean that those could be named and Creatures of that type are chosen?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, they are in fact all related; a Giant Chogus and a Giant Carillion are both abnormally large breeds of the respective Dream Creatures, while Elders have something to distinct them as well (generally, an 'Elder' of a Dream Creature race is a Dream Creature that has been around a long, long time, and because of that has learned a few unique tricks of its own compared to the younger versions). Also, it would just create too many issues to try and differentiate; what defines a Creature type? A noun (in the context of Magi-Nation)? That works just fine when you apply it to something like Baldars, but what about Sarazens? There wouldn't be any way to distinguish Sarazens, as the term 'Sarazen' is generally used as an adjective, though that's what the species is. You would just have a member of the 'Guard' Creature type and the 'Outcast' type that, while we know are related, couldn't be. And art cannot be a guide either, because that's subjective without a huge rulings list along the lines of "These cards are in this family:", which is just clunky. Any singular word (plural or not) within a Dream Creature's card title is a Creature type. Even the seemingly unrelated ones, such as Ballistic, Elder, Chaos, Giant, etc. Within the context of the ecology of the Moonlands, these Creatures actually are related, as strange as it may seem.

        If the Dreamwarp effect is mandatory and I can Dreamwarp for zero, will Vine Hyren always gain 1 energy when a creature with Dreamwarp is played?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No; effectively, unless Dreamwarp is under the effect of 'Lockdown' or something similarly restrictive, Dreamwarping for 0 satisfies the Vine Hyren's need for you to "use" Dreamwarp. The reason that the Vine Hyren simply doesn't say "whenever you play a Creature with Dreamwarp..." is because, as in the case mentioned, Locking down Dreamwarp shuts down the energy gain as well, with the current wording; functionally different from just gaining energy when a Dreamwarper is played.

        In a multiplayer game, I have a Dryte Fiend in play and name Player B's Furok Guardian (at 10 energy) 'Condemned' at the beginning of Player A's turn. Player A casts 'Stalk' on the condemned Furok Guardian and then attacks it with a 3-energy Vine Hyren. Will the Furok Guardian lose 4 energy before energy is removed because of Condemn?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Losing energy from attacks means losing energy when creatures discard energy during the remove energy step. The creature would only lose one energy from Stalking.

        First, Stalking removes one energy, reducing the Guardian to nine. Then, the Hyren and Guardian discard energy from each other; the Hyren assigns three to the Guardian, which Condemn increases to six, while the Guardian assigns nine to the Hyren. The Guardian survives the fight with three energy.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Awakening can defeat Kyg'n even though he has True Grit. True Grit only protects Kyg'n from being defeated by normal means—such as having no energy and no creatures in play—but it does not protect against specific effects that explicitly state a Magi is defeated.

        Yes, Ritual Spear can be used to defeat Kyg'n. Although True Grit restricts Kyg'n’s defeat to only occur during a direct attack, Ritual Spear is an effect that defeats a Magi directly and does not rely on the standard conditions for defeat.

        In order for Furlosk to survive there has to be in play one creature from each region. Since it doesn't say anything like 'at the end of the turn' or 'at the beginning of your turn', then this card will be discarded immediately after play. With this wording, I can't play 2 Furlosk to complete requirements if I have no creatures or just creatures from one region, right? Bograth and Narrom are regions that don't get along, and there are no other Bograth/Narrom creatures for Furlosk to be playable.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Companionship does require that you have both a Naroom Creature and a Bograth Creature under your control when Furlosk enters play. If you cannot fit this requirement, it is discarded immediately, meaning you would not be able to play one then another to keep both in play, since playing creatures is sequential, not simultaneous.

        Does the Great Throne of Mushrooms allow the mage to pay one energy whenever a creature is discarded from play, including through combat, energy discard, or specific discard effects?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Great Throne of Mushrooms triggers when a Creature leaves play and is placed into the discard pile by a 'discard' effect, such as being reduced to zero energy and discarded (e.g., in combat) or being directly discarded (e.g., by Shockwave). This includes creature defeat in combat, discarding via a Spell, Power, or Effect, or even discarding as a cost to use another card's ability. Therefore, it applies not only to 'specific discard' but also to any discard effect that results in the Creature being placed into the discard pile.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If a value is not printed on a card, such as starting energy for a Relic, then that value has a default of zero. You may still use cards to increase it above zero (like Bagala Fangs) as long as it is a Creature, and those effects will stick around until their duration passes, even if the Creature becomes a Relic again (though they still would be unable to gain energy if not a Creature).

        I don't quite understand the multiple uses of the verb "attack". For example, Agrilla's effect says "Agrilla loses one less energy in attacks." Does this mean when Agrilla attacks, when he is attacked, or in all instances where he is involved in an attack as either defender or attacker? Similarly, Bungaloo's effect says "Whenever Bungaloo is defeated in an attack..." — does this only trigger when he is the defender, or also when he is the attacker?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Whenever a card effect does not differentiate whether or not the creature involved has to be attacking or defending, then it applies to every attack the creature is involved in. In both of your examples, the effects trigger whether the creature is the attacker or defender.

        Harmony will attempt to discard X energy from each Creature in play with more than three energy, where X = (Current energy - 3).

        Not necessarily; Crushing Fungus affects the Magi that controls the Creature discarded by it. For purposes of Climbing Staff (which is where I think this question was headed), however, the Crushing Spell has already affected a Creature.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Even if a card allows your opponent a choice of punishments (such as discarding a card or paying 1 energy), regardless of what they choose, you still control the effect, so you still 'force' it to happen (such as discarding a card). This means Spectral Shield will activate in response to the discard. Similarly, Gilded Cage would also trigger because the discard is forced by your effect, even though the opponent chooses how to satisfy it.

        You may use and copy Pet Project as much as you want; however, the Power itself specifically states that the effects will only benefit the same player once per game. All other uses of it (including copies) are wasted. This is because Pet Project, when used (or copied for the first time), also creates the condition that you may only "name a non-Hyren Creature type. Until the end of the game, all Creatures of the chosen type that you play are Weave instead of their original region" once per game. Specifically, this means that any other card effect you have that has the same exact effect as what's stated above (such as a copy or using Pet Project again) cannot give any benefit.

        Enhanced Invulnerability reduces damage itself; even if Invulnerability cannot be used, Enhanced Invulnerability would still reduce the energy loss of combat to those Invulnerable Creatures by one.

        Do you have to have a magi in play to process discard-from-hand-to-prevent-something effects (like Crown, Fangs, Climbing Staff)? If not, how does discarding Fangs from your hand to prevent your opponent from discarding cards from hand work if there's no magi in play to follow the 'until this magi is defeated' clause?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Such cards with discard activated effects are never played; you reveal the text to the opponent that explains why you are discarding it, or what benefit you are getting for it being discarded, then you place it in the discard pile. If you have such a card effect that refers to 'until your Magi is defeated', and you have no active Magi, then the effect fizzles, since it cannot complete its action (giving your active Magi immunity to discard effects). With regards to cards like Climbing Staff, you cannot use its Effect if you do not have an active Magi. All Powers and Effects on Relics are used by their controller's active Magi; without a Magi active, you cannot use the Effect, just as the Magi could not use Climbing Staff in this manner if they could not use the Powers and Effects on their Relics (if they were pinned by Crushing Heat, for instance).

        On Kyber's Teeth creatures, Invulnerability says "takes one less damage during attacks." Is this only when the creature attacks, or does it also apply when the creature is attacked?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If the phrase "when attacking" or "when attacked" is not on the effect to make a distinction, then the effect applies whenever the creature is attacking or defending. In regards to Invulnerability, yes, the creature takes one less energy whether it is the attacker or defender.

        How does the regional penalty affect multi-regional creatures and magi? If my magi is from one of the two regions on a multi-region card, do they not pay the penalty? What about multi-regional magi—for example, if a magi is Naroom/Orothe, can they play cards from both regions without the penalty?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        A Magi may play cards of any of their specified regions, ignoring regional restrictions and penalties. Your friend's Weave/Naroom Magi can play Naroom, Weave, Weave/Cald, Core cards playable by Naroom Magi, and any other card normally playable by any Naroom or Weave Magi. As for only having one region in its template, this is so that players who prefer the look of a specific region, or would like to keep their Magi appearance consistent (for instance, in an otherwise single-region deck).

      <div class="clarification-answer">

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Lockdown does not depend on the offending Power or Effect remaining in play, and does not 'shut off' until the Belt itself leaves play or the duration of Lockdown ends. As such, if your opponent has, for instance, Evu in play, and you Lockdown Lore before defeating him, the opponent could not then reveal their Magi next turn then play and use Book of Ages.

        How does Dreamwarp work on a creature like Rala from Paradwyn?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Whenever you play a Creature with Dreamwarp, you may choose to play it with its printed starting energy increased or decreased by one (to a minimum of one). Increasing the starting energy raises both the cost to play and the amount of energy the creature enters play with by one. Decreasing it lowers both the cost and the energy it enters play with by one. Regardless of your choice, at the end of that turn, the creature's starting energy returns to the number printed on the card. Note that changing the starting energy does not affect the creature's current energy.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Alpine Xamf's effect does not apply to the first Alpine Xamf played because the effect triggers when the Xamf enters play, which is too late for it to gain additional energy.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, as long as the Magi is otherwise eligible (for instance, not Cald in the case of Firefly Swarm), you may target a Magi instead of a Creature. However, since Magi do not attack but their Creatures do, the other effects of the Firefly cards that rely on attacking are not applicable.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        There has been some inconsistency in previous rulings, and that's cleared up with this simple rule: If a card has 'game text' (like TJ, AC, or Underlord's Shield) you do not need an active Magi to play the card. You need an active Magi to use any 'Effect' on a card, even the ones in your hand (this means you cannot play Climbing Staff from your hand while you have no active Magi).

        D'Jarvish's effect is a replacement effect; the creature is returned to the hand instead of discarded, but the source of that action is still the opposing card. If the opponent Shockwaved one of D'Jarvish's Pylofufs (or any other eligible creature) while he had Motash's Staff in play, he would still get the energy that the creature had returned to him.

        I want to know if Korrits are affected by Rayje's Sword Piercing effect? And if the korrit is affected, how is damage divided? For example, if there is a Rayje's Sword in play and I have a 3 energy Parmaleg and a 5 energy Giant Korrit. My opponent has an 8 energy Yarothis. So I attack with my Parmaleg and my Giant Korrit joins the attack. Does the Giant Korrit lose energy? How much energy will it lose since Parmaleg was also attacking? Is the energy divided in any way? Are both of my creatures discarded?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        As far as the rules are concerned, Pack Hunt gives the Korrits an additional time when they can attack, but otherwise, it is still an attack in and of itself. Pack Hunt also reduces the energy lost by the Korrit in the attack to zero. Normally, the defending creature assigns its energy total to be removed from all attacking creatures in the attack, as per the rules. Then, Pack Hunt reduces the energy to be removed from the Korrits to zero. With Piercing in effect, Pack Hunt cannot reduce the energy loss. Example: Piercing is in effect, and I attack my opponent's 5E Junjertrug with my 3E Bisiwog and Pack Hunt with my 5E Giant Korrit. Normally, the Junjertrug would lose 8E, the Bisiwog 5E, and the Giant Korrit nothing. However, since energy loss cannot be reduced, the Junjertrug discards 5E from the Giant Korrit as well. Final result: I lose my Giant Korrit and Bisiwog defeating your Junjertrug.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Effects, as long as you may use them, are always triggered whenever the conditions for them are met. These conditions can be as general as "whenever a Creature enters play" or so specific as "whenever you play a Naroom Creature." Whatever the case, if the Effect does not say that you "may" do it, or does not list a limited number of times to do it (such as once per turn), then you must carry out the instructions of the Effect each time its conditions are met, even if it's your Effect and you don't want to.

        Yes, the Magi would gain five energy. Dual-region cards are always considered to be both of their regions. If you are comparing regions of cards, and at least one region is a match, the cards are considered to be from the same region. In this case, Pruitt's Flame Rudwot is considered to be of Pruitt's region. The same would be true of Tryn Flamesaver's (Naroom/Cald) Bungaloo (Naroom/Weave).

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        All cards are played by Magi. Magi themselves are never 'played'. Powers and Effects, as well as Creatures and Magi, come from those specific cards. While you need a Magi in play to use a Power or Effect on a Relic, the Relic itself is still the source of the Power or Effect. If a card prevents a Magi from using Powers or Effects, but doesn't specifically state that the Magi can't use Powers or Effects on Relics, then the Relics can still be used. For example, Sandswirl states 'The chosen Creature or Magi cannot use Powers or Effects...', while Crushing Heat states 'the creature's Magi cannot use Powers or Effects or P/E on their Relics...'

        Gia may only play relics with Unearth that she could legally play under normal circumstances; this generally applies only to Universal and Weave relics.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Whenever a dual-region card's region is referenced, if it is of that region, it counts as only that region and not both; it counts as either needed, so the card suffers all benefits and drawbacks of being each region.

      <div class="clarification-answer">

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No; because using a Power or Spell is not optional with Bloom, you could not play it then not use a Power or Spell. If you play Bloom and have no Powers or Spells to play, you must take back the playing of the Bloom (and get that energy back).

        You may only play one Bloom in response to each of your opponent's actions, as Bloom states that it must be played 'immediately after' your opponent does one of the listed actions. By the time you have processed one Bloom, it is no longer 'Immediately after' the original action took place.

        If I have a Nkala and Bahzra's Pendant in play, Bloom in hand, and 0e on my Magi, and my opponent plays a relic, can I choose the order to use the triggered effects from Bahzra's Pendant and Bloom, even though both say 'immediately after'?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, you may choose the order in which to resolve the triggered effects. Although both effects state 'immediately after,' they are separate triggers that can be ordered by the player whose turn it is. This means you can use Bahzra's Pendant to Support with Nkala to 1e first, then use Bloom to play another power on one of your other cards in play.

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Does the word 'immediately' have any real timing importance? For example, if I have a Phrup in play and Bloom in hand, and my opponent plays Tomorrow's Jewel triggering both Bloom and Phrup, can I choose to resolve Phrup before Bloom (which is more advantageous), even though Phrup does not say 'immediately'?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, you may choose the order of resolution. Since Phrup does not have an 'immediately after' restriction, it can be resolved at any time during the appropriate window, allowing you to use Phrup first if desired. However, Bloom must be played immediately after your opponent's action and cannot be delayed.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You may only play one Bloom in response to each of your opponent's actions. Since Bloom must be played 'immediately after' your opponent performs an action, you cannot use a second Bloom once the first has been resolved—by then, it is no longer 'immediately after' the original action.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Phrup must be used before the opposing card enters play and before any of its effects resolve; therefore, if you Phrup your opponent's card, no effects that would trigger from it coming into play or being played will occur.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        During X player's last turn means During X player's last completed turn. This means you could still only Dreamthump something that had used a Power on your opponent's last turn, not something that has used one during the current turn.

        Which interpretation is correct for the Drought card effect: does it prevent only cards in play when Drought was played from energizing next time, or does it apply to any card energizing during the next energize step regardless of when it entered play?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Drought stops all cards in play under a player's control from gaining energy the next time that the player must energize, whether it is during the energize step or from a card such as Flood of Energy. It applies to every card in play during that next energize action, even ones that were not in play when Drought was played.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Phrup can stop the discard of a Climbing Staff to prevent damage because using the Climbing Staff's Effect is considered 'playing' the card. In MND, playing a card includes discarding it from your hand and following its instructions, which is exactly how Climbing Staff works. Any card that uses an effect to emulate this action is treated as being played and can be targeted by Phrup. Cards that use rules text instead of effects for similar actions are not considered 'played' and cannot be stopped by Phrup.

        Weave Tactics and Watch are triggered simultaneously and resolve in the order you choose. When you switch defenders with Weave Tactics, you reset all steps of the attack, and all Speags gain two energy again because the defender is different. If you switched back to the original defender after using Weave Tactics, the Speags would not trigger again, as effects do not retrigger in an attack unless the attacker or defender changes to something that has not been the attacker or defender yet in the current attack.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        While Big Chill is in effect, creatures cannot gain energy past their starting energy. Since energizing is not considered gaining energy, a creature like a Rabbage can still energize beyond its starting energy.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        When energy removal is altered by another card in play, what aspect of the game is being affected—source, target, or does it depend on context?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The energy loss itself is being affected, not the source or the target. For example, if a Rock Hyren has Invulnerability and is targeted by an effect that causes energy loss, such as Tar Hyren's ability, the Invulnerability will prevent that energy loss.

        If Player A has just played a Storm of Fishes and has called Spells, and Player B has both an Abraxin's Crown and a Moob Ring in hand, can Player B first discard the Abraxin's Crown and then the Moob Ring in response to Player A's attempt to force Player B to discard cards from their hand?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When forced to discard one or more cards from hand, Player B may choose to discard either the Abraxin's Crown or the Moob Ring instead of any other cards. However, once a card is discarded this way, the discard effect ends and no further discards occur, so Player B cannot discard both cards in response. The Moob Ring's anti-discard effect does not activate after the initial discard because the effect has already been resolved by choosing to discard one relic instead.

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Does the word 'instead' on both the Abraxin's Crown and Moob Ring mean that discarding one of them only saves a single card from being discarded, or does it completely negate the spell, power, or effect causing the discard?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The word 'instead' means that discarding either the Abraxin's Crown or the Moob Ring fully replaces the required discard action. It allows the player to avoid discarding any other cards in hand due to the effect—effectively saving all other cards in hand from being discarded. The entire discard effect is negated for those cards by sacrificing one relic.

        Yes, the Brushfire would be placed back into Player A's hand, even if played from the discard pile; this would be true for any card played from an out-of-play area other than the opposing player's hand, as Time Lapse lacks the 'plays a card from their hand' clause.

        Yes, you may use Loaded Dice with Cragnok or Greater Vaal, but you must pay one energy per single die you wish to 'split' into two rolls, and you must roll each pair separately—meaning you cannot roll all four dice at once and pick the best two; instead, you roll two dice, choose one result, then roll another two dice and choose one result.

        Since discarding from the hand is still considered 'playing', does Tuku's ability preventing magi from playing non-universal relics also prevent them from discarding such relics from their hand, and how does this relate to cards like Climbing Staff and Abraxin's Crown?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Any Effect that emulates playing a card (either putting it into play [Creature/Relic], or processing actions on a card in your hand and then discarding that card [Spell]) is considered 'playing the card'. Any Game text that does this is not considered playing the card, since rules text has always been above and beyond the reach of normal card interactions. In this case, since Tuku prevents you from playing non-Universal Relics, you could not use a Climbing Staff while his restriction was in effect, though you could use Abraxin's Crown.

        The additional energy discard of Roar applies only to the next attack made; the second attack from Fear will not grant any additional bonuses.

        Yes. In order for the Relic Mirror to function properly, it must trigger before the Relic it would protect is discarded—just like Phrup triggers before a card hits the table. If your opponent plays Inhibitor Band, you can activate the Relic Mirror's ability to save another Universal Relic.

        Relic Mirror's wording is awkward and will be corrected if reprinted. Until then, treat it as having the following text, which reflects design intent: "Effect - Trick Image: As an opposing Spell or Power that discards Relics from play would affect one of your other Relics in play, choose one of those Relics and discard Relic Mirror from play. The Spell or Power does not affect the chosen Relic." This matches the intended function of saving relics even from global destruction effects, which the current wording technically fails to do.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        Based on last week's ruling, counting the number of cards is not affecting a hand, but looking at the cards and doing nothing to them is? What exactly are all the things that count as "affecting a hand"? As I see it, right now in the game, I can: Count the cards in your hand, Look at the cards in your hand, Make you discard a card from your hand, Make you draw a card and put it in your hand. Which of these 4 things counts as "affecting"?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        To expand on the previous definition of "affecting a hand" with an overall definition of affecting an out of play area (hand, deck, or discard pile), you only affect the area when you either A - gain previously unknown knowledge about it (revealing the hand or cards from the deck) or B - change the contents of the area (move cards from the discard pile, hand, or deck, to a new area, into or out of play). Basically put, counting the cards in hand does not affect it, because hand size is public knowledge; most people ask the opponent how many cards are in their hand, but, technically speaking, you could count it for yourself and then calculate the energy loss for a Spirit Drain, etc.

        Should future cards separate 'cost' from 'effect' in power design, given that discarding a creature for Impact is not considered a cost while discarding for Implosion is?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        With regards to cost...This is a templating issue we will address. However, the difference, for now, is generally apparent: when you have to lose something you own or control before you get an effect from the Power or Spell, it's a cost. This is why, whereas Implosion's card discard is a cost, Impact's Creature discard is not, because the discard happens after you've started carrying out other, potentially beneficial, effects of the Spell. Spells and Powers as a norm have their effects happen sequentially; when you have to lose something before the Spell or Power has an effect, it's a cost, if it happens afterwards, its part of the Spell effect (and some resistances may apply).

        Explain in detail the design and issues with the card Climbing Staff.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Climbing Staff was never intended to be an unstoppable shield; it breaks the rhythm of the game in a poor direction to do so. One of the appealing factors has always been, once it's your turn, you know what can and cannot happen—the worst the opponent could do is use what Effects they have on their side of the table, but as long as you planned your attack accordingly, you could guarantee a fair level of success. Within that measure also ran the risk of having to play intelligently and not be committed in such a way so as to let the opponent have such a guaranteed chance. Some regions (namely Paradwyn) occasionally break this mold, but that is in the spirit of what they were intended to do. Climbing Staff, if unstoppable, has the potential to lower the playing quality of the competitive environment. With such effective countermeasures available, a player can commit themselves much more recklessly with a 'safety net' and not worry about the consequences. And as for the 'victim' of the Staff, it can be needlessly frustrating when it is the only factor stopping you from a precisely calculated win. While it is a factor that could be accounted for, if you know it's a possibility, there should still be a means of stopping it.

        If I have more than one Chogus in play, will their effects activate simultaneously or do they overlap and cancel each other out?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Unless noted otherwise in the effect, all redundant effects will occur simultaneously when their conditions are met. They would effectively overlap since both do the exact same thing, and it's a static change, so you would essentially get no benefit from extra Choguses in play.

        When a card is played that checks for other cards in play, does it also check itself if it meets the requirements to trigger its own power or effect?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        It depends on how the effect is phrased; in Alpine Xamf's case, the effect must be active before it can occur, and since Xamf isn't in play yet, the effect isn't active. Other effects, like Flame Trulb, check once the creature has entered play and count itself. The wording determines whether self-reference occurs, so always examine the exact phrasing of the ability.

        Whenever you change the results of something by applying both a 'cap' to it (changing it to a specific number) and also altering the base amount (such as reducing energy loss), the reduction is applied before the cap.

        If I have ongoing spell effects such as Will of Orothe, Tranquility, or Focus and my Magi is defeated before the spell's effect happens, what happens to the spell effect? Does it cease to exist like spells on table (like Dream Channel), or does it continue to operate similar to creature powers (like Tree Hinko's Invigorate power)?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Such ongoing Spell effects last until they have expired, either by doing what they are supposed to do (e.g., Deadfalling two Creatures) or their duration has expired (the end of the chosen player's next turn, as is Will of Orothe's case). Focus is a special case; while it will not increase the energize rate of your next Magi if the one that played it is defeated, your next Magi will still be unable to play cards until the end of your turn after Focus was played (the biggest risk of all with the Spell).

      <div class="clarification-question">
        Why was Ullig MRP'd? I could only find one way she could be broken, and the new MRP makes her almost useless due to her low energize rate and very conditional power. The concern about an infinite energy loop with Kybar's Echo and a Quido Swarm (from Bograth/Paradwyn) seems unnecessary since Moss Quido is not Kybar's Teeth. The only way the loop could happen is if Kybar's Echo was quilled to read Bograth or Paradwyn, which is extremely rare. Unless Ullig is broken in another way—especially with the MRP on Kybar's Echo (which I support)—I ask that you please change her back.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Ullig is far from useless; the conditions of her Effect are still very easy to fulfill, because it is triggered any time an opposing card forces your final Creature to be discarded from play, either by directly discarding it, or reducing it to zero energy (in attacks, opposing Spells, etc).

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Such non-functional MRPs create unnecessary confusion; additionally, the phrase "if specific discarded" no longer exists, and all instances of it should be replaced with "if discarded while it has energy." While this issue will be handled when the card is reprinted, it's not needed now.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Delia gains the effect of Staff of Keepers when playing Arderial cards. Staff of Keepers only requires that you not name the region of your Magi when it is first played; if you later Interchange to a Magi from the named region, you still receive the benefits.

        In the first example, Lava Flow CAN affect the Lovian, as far as discarding energy, so the Lovian may be chosen.

        If I play a creature (Greenstuff) and the Magi Ogar then which effect happens first—would Ogar get to roll or would I add one to Green Stuff?

        The active player gets to resolve all of their effects first, in the order they choose, then the next in player order gets to do the same, until all effects are resolved; because you played the Green Stuff, it would get its energy, then Ogar would get to use Feral Instinct. As for multiplayer, A would choose the order that all of your simultaneous effects resolve, resolve them, then so would B, C, then D. If it was B's turn, it would be B, C, D, then A, etc.

        If Zajan goes first, does he energize at the end of the turn, draw two cards at the beginning, or both?

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Regardless of when it happens during the first turn of the game, the first time that player's Magi should energize, they do not energize as normal. If the energize is somehow shifted to somewhere aside from the Energize step and another energize effect happens (such as Flood of Energy), then that energize effect for that Magi will be cancelled by the rule, but the energize would happen normally later that turn. Zajan still has his energize step, so he would draw two cards, but by the rules, he would not normally energize during the Draw step if he went first on the very first turn of the game. However, if he played Flood of Energy during his turn, though he'd gain no energy then, he would gain energy during the Draw step.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When Big Chill goes into effect, any creatures with more energy than their starting energy remain at that amount. Big Chill only prevents adding energy beyond a creature's starting energy; it does not reduce existing energy. If an effect would add energy and cause a creature to exceed its starting energy, no additional energy is added once the creature reaches its starting energy.

        The first half of the Move effect will occur (discard all but one energy from your Magi) when the Magi energizes, but the second half (add that much energy) will be restricted by Big Chill, so that if the energy add would raise the energy on Pyder above its starting, then no energy above its starting will be added (essentially making the energy lost).

        Can the Korremar + Gia Pet card combo lock down your opponent's drawing capabilities completely?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If the opponent had not drawn any cards outside of their Draw step, then they would still get to draw one card. Effectively, under normal circumstances of drawing two cards per turn, Gia Pet and Korremar do the same thing but through different mechanics. Korremar states 'Once you've drawn a card, you can draw no more this turn,' which triggers after a card is successfully drawn. Gia Pet reduces the number of cards drawn by one, meaning the player draws X-1 cards where X is the normal amount. Since reductions are applied before caps, even when both effects are active, the opponent still gets to draw at least one card during their Draw step. This also applies to League Elder: while he ignores Gia Pet's restriction because he draws until his hand has five cards, Korremar will cap him at one card draw per turn, preventing any additional draws such as those from Warrada's Ring.

        When Phlouk has less energy than the starting energy of a Ring Tested creature at the end of the turn, what happens? Specifically, if Phlouk has three energy but the creature requires four, does the creature get discarded without removing all available energy from Phlouk?

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The events of Ring Testing occur sequentially: first, discard energy from Phlouk equal to the starting energy of the Ring Tested Creature; if there is not enough energy on Phlouk to do so, then the Creature is discarded. If no Ring Tested Creature remains in play, no further action is required.

        Can I use Dreamburn to hit a Magi with spells like Ambush, Storm Cloud, Syphon Vortex, Brushfire, and Thunderquake when no creatures are in play?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Dreamburn can be used to target a Magi with those spells when no creatures are in play, as long as the spell or power only discards energy from one creature or magi. The key requirement for Dreamburn is that energy must be discarded from only one creature by a spell; since the move mechanic involves discarding energy, you can legally use Dreamburn to apply Syphon Vortex to an opposing Magi and move X energy (or all they have, whichever is less) to your magi. Similarly: Ambush is legal and discards energy equal to the Magi's starting energy; Storm Cloud is legal and reduces the opposing Magi to one energy; Brushfire is legal and discards two energy from the Magi; Thunderquake is legal as long as you do not attempt to split its effect among multiple magi. Dreamburn works with any spell or power that discards energy from only one creature or magi, provided there is only one target affected. For example, if only one opposing creature is in play, you can Dreamburn a Fire Chogo's Power and discard energy from the opposing Magi. However, in a multiplayer game, you cannot Dreamburn Maelstrom even if an opponent has only one creature, because it would affect multiple magi—Dreamburn cannot be used when there are multiple potential targets.

        Usagi asks about Flame Trulb's ability: "Add one energy to FT for every C or BR creature in play, which ever is less." If there are no BR creatures and 3 C creatures, does it get +2E or +5E?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The effect triggers only after the Trulb is in play, so it counts itself. It adds energy equal to the lesser number of Creature types in play—so if there are only Cald (C) creatures, including the Trulb, it would add +1E because there is one Bograth (BR) creature (the Trulb itself), and thus the minimum is 1. If all creatures in play were Cald, the Trulb would still get +1E since there's only one Bograth creature (itself). It will only gain more than one energy if multiple Flame Trulbs are already in play.

        When Liriel's Cape is discarded for its Mass Heal effect, do creatures with Dreamwarp gain an additional eight energy due to both Radiant Spring and Liriel's Cape effects?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, the creatures would gain no energy above their starting energy. First, since Liriel's Cape is discarded from play before the energy is added, it is not in play to grant the +3 bonus to starting energy. Second, Radiant Spring only applies to Dreamwarping creatures when they are played; it does not increase the starting energy of creatures with Dreamwarp by five unless they were actually played that turn and warped up by five.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Player A can use Um...No! to protect Orpus and still use Orpus to save Motash's Staff. Even if Um...No! is not used, the energy from Orpus can be discarded to save the Staff from Cataclysm because a Creature does not lose its energy total until it actually enters an out of play area. The key timing is that when D'Jarvish's burrowed or illusionary Creatures are returned to hand (after being discarded by Cataclysm), Motash's Staff's effect triggers as they begin their return, adding their energy totals to D'Jarvish at that moment—before they forget their energy. This occurs before the cards fully leave play, so the energy is still valid.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No. By the rules and text, there are two types of resistance, and so the following occurs:

Piercing vs "The Spell, Power, or Effect does nothing." - The effects of the Spell, Power, or Effect basically never happen; there is no energy loss to reduce, because the Spell, Power, or Effect did not even attempt to discard energy to begin with. Piercing will not allow energy discard to happen.

Piercing vs "This Creature is not affected by Spells, Powers, or Effects of the specified region/etc." - In this case, the Spell, Power, or Effect does nothing to the Resistant card, but still has its effects on everything else in play. Since the Spell/Power/Effect never attempts to discard energy from the Creature, energy loss cannot be reduced, and Piercing cannot take effect.

On an additional note, it has previously been ruled that you cannot play a Spell or use a Power if you can't select a Creature in play to be affected by it because of Resistance (or similar Effects); this is both a violation of the spirit and the mechanics of the rules, and is hereby reversed. So you may now Shockwave opposing Colossuses to your heart's content, it will just do nothing to them if they have their Anti-Magic. Any new questions to arise from this ruling should be directed to the listserv.

        Can you play Climbing Staff from your hand with no active Magi?

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, but only in specific situations; if an opposing card is affecting only your hand, as the hand is the player's domain, then the player may use the Effect to protect it, and negate the Spell/Power/Effect. If the Staff will be affecting only the Magi (basically an impossibility with no Magi in play), then the Magi must be able to use Effects on Relics in order to discard it for its Spell/Power/Effect negation. So even if you are under the effects of Crushing Heat, you may still protect your hand, but your Magi can still not protect themselves. This ruling applies specifically to Climbing Staff currently because it is the only Effect that can be used without being in play. The card will be changed to eliminate such an exemption if reprinted.

        If you have Spells not of the Purity region in your discard pile, then the rest of Purity will not trigger, and your Magi will not be defeated.

        If a player is forced to discard cards from their hand and only Abraxin's Crown and Gilded Cage are in their hand, which card's ability activates first?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The player may choose the order in which the effects resolve. However, only one of the two anti-discard effects can be triggered because Abraxin's Crown has the word "instead" and negates the entire discard event when used. If the Crown is discarded instead of other cards, the discard event is prevented, so the Gilded Cage cannot trigger. Conversely, if the Gilded Cage is discarded (allowing it to trigger), then the Crown’s effect cannot activate because no discard event occurs. Therefore, only one effect can resolve—either the Crown's prevention or the Cage's ability—but not both.

        If my opponent's Magi has more energy than their listed Starting Energy (for example: Gar's Starting Energy is 14), and I play Abraxin's Crown, then cast an Intensify, followed by a 'Dreamburned' Equilibrate targeting their Magi, does the Magi first remove all excess energy above starting energy, and then additionally lose energy equal to what the Intensify caused the Equilibrate to remove?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If the Equilibrate can legally affect the Magi, it will reduce the Magi's energy to its Starting Energy and then discard an additional amount equal to what was removed due to the Intensify. So if a Magi has 19 energy with a Starting Energy of 15, it will lose 8 energy total.

        The rule specifying that updraft effects use only 'printed starting energy' applies consistently across all such effects, including those from Bagala Fangs and Dream Balming. While Dreamwarp changes the number displayed in the corner of the card and creates a temporary starting energy value for most purposes, this temporary value is not used by updraft effects. The printed starting energy remains the sole reference for these specific mechanics.

        Played: When a card is successfully moved from an out of play area and placed on the table in play. As a Creature is being played: After the Creature card has been revealed and all costs have been paid, but before the Creature has been put on the table.

        Why do some decks without Kybar's Teeth Magi include a Climbing Staff if Cald Magi cannot use other region's relics unless stated?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        A Cald Magi may not bring into play a non-Universal non-Cald Relic unless the Relic specifically allows it or the Magi states they can. However, Climbing Staff's unnamed effect does not require it to be brought into play to be used, and so any Magi can use the card for Magi/Hand protection by discarding it.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No. Spirit Drain does not choose to discard energy from a Magi; instead, it chooses a player, making the energy discard incidental. Since Dreamburn only allows Spells and Powers that can specifically choose to discard energy from a single Magi or a single Creature to be changed to also allow the other type, Spirit Drain cannot be affected by Dreamburn because its choice is not about discarding energy but selecting a player.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        It loses only the two energy. Pack Defense does not discard energy; it only allows the Striped Korrit to make itself an additional defender in the attack. In this case, unless the Korrit only had one energy, then having Striped Korrit Pack Defense benefits you none.

        What is a cost?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        A cost is when a Spell, Power, or Effect causes you to choose something of yours that you will lose as part of the Spell, Power, or Effect, regardless of which point in the resolution that loss occurs. While there's no absolute rule, a good guideline is whether you lose something before gaining a generally beneficial effect; however, this addendum clarifies that any such choice constitutes a cost. Common sense typically determines what counts as a cost, and while most cards are played as intended, exceptions may arise where strict interpretation is preferred—players should ask if uncertain.

        Are terms like 'Jungle Stalker' on creature cards considered creature types, and can they be targeted by effects that reference creature types such as Scyalla's ability or Sarazen Outcast's extra fighting energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No; Jungle Stalker is not a Creature type. When a card references a Creature type, it can only choose cards with whole words in the Name of a Creature on the card, ignoring plurality. The term 'Jungle Stalker' is part of the card's title, which is unrelated to Creature type; the only exception is when the title lists 'Alternate XXXX,' then the creature in question also counts as a Creature of that type in addition to what's listed. Jungle Stalkers are a sub-group of Creatures with related abilities, and the design team wants cards to be able to key off of that group without also having to lump those creatures together with the same Creature type. This will not be the first group to make such a distinction, as you will see more in VotS.

        Caps are always applied after reductions. Gia Pet will try and make you draw one less than two, which is a reduction to one and then Korremar only lets you draw one card as the cap so you'll still get the one card. In the case of Evu or a Magi who would be drawing more than two, where you would normally draw three or more, the Impede reduces that total by one and then Mind Shock caps the draw at one.

        Universal Magi must pay a regional penalty to play all cards. Why would they be subject to this when no one else has to pay penalties to play theirs? (Just kinda wanted an explanation on this one really.)
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Universal Magi are from their own region, which is a jack-of-all-trades and yet a master of none. They must pay a regional penalty for all non-Universal cards while non-Universal Magi continue to have no penalty for Universal cards. The Universal 'region' is what the Eliwan wielded initially from the time they started using the magic of the Moonlands. It is the basis for which all magic of the Moonlands is founded; later on, different regional founders and elders tempered the practices and learnings of the Eliwan to tailor their own distinct styles of magic, encompassing the summoning of non-Universal Dream Creatures as well. While regional Magi had to learn the Eliwan teachings as a foundation for their more specialized, regional-specific forms of magic, Universal Magi never fully graduated beyond the initial Eliwan teachings, either by choice (Rayje), lack of access (Tuku), or lack of practice (Tony Jones).

        If I go first with a Gia Pet in play, does my opponent only get four cards? (Vortex of Knowledge affects initial card drawing)
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No; there is a specific process in determining your starting hand. First, you retrieve all of your starting cards, to a maximum of five. Then if you have less than five cards, draw until you have five. The only card printed so far that directly affects the Starting Hand mechanic is Dark Twins because they say you are allowed to draw up to seven instead of the regular five. As for the Vortex of Knowledge and any other cards that would cause you to draw cards before you have gotten your starting hand, they work as such: Vortex causes you to draw two cards, then you get your starting cards, to a maximum of five. After getting your starting cards, if you still have less than five cards, draw until you have five. If you use Vortex of Knowledge on Good Ol' Ashgar, he draws two and then gets to go look for and retrieve an Arbolit, Quor, Flame Geyser, Boomstick, and Krawg if he has them in his deck, but Strag would still have to give up one of his starting cards, the Gum Gum, Parmalag, Bottomless Pit, Urhail, Strag's Claws, or Strag's Ring.

        How does Tsunami work with The Last Words?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Pyromancy does not remove energy from a Creature, it only allows the Power to remove more energy. All Creatures in play would lose four energy. Pyromancy also sets up a Global Restriction on the rest of your cards however, so Tsunami along with the rest of your Spells, Powers, and Effects may never even attempt to discard energy from an opposing Magi.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        By established precedence, if the Burrow status is granted by an opposing card, the Tsunami will discard two additional energy (total of four), since opposing cards cannot alter the amount discarded by it. If the Burrow status is granted by one of your cards for some reason, however, the energy loss will be reduced.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No; there are two entirely different situations being compared. Climbing Staff can be played as a reaction to something that's final result is affecting only your Magi or hand, so the check is made at that time. With Abraxin's Crown, Dreamburn checks to see if the Spell is appropriate before it is cast. Dreamburn states that if a Spell says it discards energy from a single Creature or Magi, the discard can be instead changed to the other Type. In its simplest form, before the Spell or Power is used, read the text with the Type switched. In the case of Spirit Drain, it would read: "Choose any one player. Discard energy from the chosen player's Creature equal to the number of cards in that player's hand." As you mentioned, this would only theoretically work if you had exactly one creature in play. Since there is no choice made and it is possible for the Spell to result in an illegal case, it cannot be Dreamburned. Dreamburn can only be used with Spells and Powers that can choose to affect only one target.

        No; Nightmare's Dawn was created and phrased to reward those players that maintained regional purity, even with the new options presented by dual-region cards. The second player's Magi is only Weave, and the Baby Furok is not only Weave, so the Magi does not receive the energy. For the Magi to receive energy, not only would all of the other cards in addition to the Baby Furok that Magi had in play have to be Naroom/Weave, but the Magi itself would have to be as well. To prevent any confusion that can be caused by sentence structure, however, and to fix a generally unwieldy wording, treat Nightmare's Dawn as if the text were as follows: Nightmare's Dawn Universal Spell Cost: 2 Add five energy to each Magi whose cards in play share all of their regions with their Magi.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        If an opponent's creature (such as a 2e Parmalag that has used its Shield power) attacks one of Kolte's creatures (such as a 5e Weave Hyren) and takes a Pack Hunting 3e Korrit with it, which creature gets hit by Kolte's Parting Shot effect? Does the Parmalag and Korrit inflict damage simultaneously, and can I choose which creature copes the Parting Shot?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No; in Magi-Nation, when events occur simultaneously, they are still resolved sequentially, in play order beginning with the active player and then each player's effects in the order they choose. In this case, both the Korrit and Parmalag attempt to discard energy simultaneously, but because of the timing structure, the controller of the creatures chooses which creature removes energy first and which second (the defending player also chooses which attacker the Weave Hyren removes 5E from first, then which second, after the attacker since the attacker is the inactive player). Note that Pack Hunt will still stop the defending creature from removing energy from the Korrit, meaning Piercing, etc., will not let the Korrit lose energy anyway. If the Parmalag discards energy first, then the Korrit will be the one defeating the Hyren and will be the victim of Parting Shot, though unaffected by it. If the Korrit discards energy first, then the Parmalag will be affected by Parting Shot instead when it defeats the Hyren, but its energy loss will be reduced to zero if Shield is in effect.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No; the Shield will prevent the Parmalag from being defeated when the Lascinth removes energy, but the Korrit will still be around to remove its energy from the Lascinth when it's the Korrit's turn. If the Shield were not in place, the Parmalag would be discarded before energy was removed.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Tunnel Parmalag only loses two energy; Regal Presence is a replacement effect that replaces the amount initially removed by the Eebit. Essentially, the Eebit only attempts to remove two energy, not four, so the extra two energy is not reduced because it was never attempted to be removed.

        Does the Nightmare's Dawn ruling change past precedence regarding dual-region cards? For example, if I play an Ormagon, are my opponent's Underneath creatures no longer just Underneath and therefore discarded? Would Typhoon affect Hurricane Orish or Bubble Xyx?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, the precedence was not changed. A dual-region card is still all of its regions simultaneously, but in almost every case only one region matters at a time. When a card effect checks for a region on a dual-region card, check if the region matches, then apply the following: If an effect affects only this region and type (e.g., Choose a Naroom Creature), and one of the regions on the card is Naroom, it is a valid choice because it is Naroom. If an effect does not affect cards of only this region (e.g., Discard all non-Underneath Relics from play), and one of the regions on a Relic is Underneath, then it will not be affected because it is Underneath and therefore not non-Underneath. Thus, your Urigant is safe from Devastate, and your Hurricane Orish is unscathed by Typhoon.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, you can use Climbing Staff to counter Riptide in that situation. When a player casts Riptide and has fewer than four cards in their hand, they do not discard any cards, so their hand is not affected. According to the definition of 'affect,' a hand is only considered affected when its contents are changed (such as through discarding) or revealed. Since the opponent's hand remains unchanged, it is not affected. Therefore, Riptide only affects your hand, and Climbing Staff can be discarded in response to prevent the effect from occurring.

        Zannah was MRPed to opposing turns only; additionally, unlike Resistance style effects, which prevent energy removal from ever being applied to what they protect, Zannah waits for the removal to be applied, then removes the removal, effectively reducing it to zero.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Corrupt does not actually affect a Magi; choosing a card and affecting it are separate events. Corrupt attaches to a Magi but does not alter its game state—such as changing energy, removing it from play, or otherwise impacting it—so it does not count as 'affecting' the Magi. Therefore, using Corrupt on a Magi during their first turn is legal, and you can also use other effects like Hubdra's Spear, Warrior's Boots, or magi-damaging spells after attaching Corrupt, as long as those effects directly impact the Magi.

Research will not allow your Magi to play a Crushing Spell that your Magi could not already play, because the only regional restrictions recognized by the rules are: Core Magi - The inability to play non-Core, non-Universal cards. Non-Core Magi - The inability to play Core Cards and non-Universal Relics not of their region.

        In an online match, one player locked down Shell Game a turn after it was used. Does this mean that Arosa keeps the creature at the end of the other player's turn, or does she return the opposing player's creature?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes; Arosa's Effect attaches a specific duration to the exchange, and when that duration passes, all Creatures left in play will return to their owner, even if Arosa has been defeated (another possible way of creating an 'orphan' Creature).

        Does Rayje's Belt work retroactively? For example, a player is playing as Ellios and uses Dream Hard. He then plays a Rayje's Belt and locks down Dream Hard. Does he get the benefit of Dream Hard, or does Rayje's Belt go back and nullify the use of that particular Dream Hard?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No; again, these Effects have a specific duration, and will still finish resolving even if the source of the effect is shut down. In these cases, Lockdown simply prevents the Effect from activating again during Lockdown's duration. The easy way to look at this is with, say, Elios, as per your example. Let's say Dream Hard is a cannon that fires during the Energize step and its cannonball hits the target during the Draw step. Once the cannon has fired, you can destroy the cannon if you like, but that will do nothing to stop the cannonball from taking effect during the Draw step ('resolving' the cannon's 'Effect'). This is similar to why a Creature leaving play when using a Power doesn't stop the Power from resolving; if a Creature blows itself up lobbing a fireball at you, it's extinction will not stop the fireball flying at you from hitting, either.

        When two card effects are triggered simultaneously, the owner of the effects chooses the order they resolve in. Both effects mentioned will be triggered at the same time (end of your turn), and since you control the order they resolve in, you choose which will resolve first. If you resolve Purity first, then M'rika will gain five energy, and then Interchange will fail because she has energy. If you resolve Interchange first, M'rika will interchange, the next Magi will receive their starting energy, then Purity will resolve and add five energy to the new Magi.

        Why were energy transfer cards changed and which ones?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Energy transfer cards were changed to place a starting energy 'cap' on them, aligning with the mechanics of Updraft effects. Previously, these cards allowed open-ended energy transfers, enabling decks to create large Creatures and transfer all their energy to Magi in a single card cycle—unlike Updraft effects, which required multiple actions. To prevent abuse, the cards were redesigned so they now have a capped starting energy and allow variable movement of energy rather than requiring full transfer. This change maintains versatility while preventing infinite loops or overpowered energy cycling. The affected cards are: Cloud Narth (Starting Energy: 2), Pharan (Starting Energy: 3), Diobor (Starting Energy: 6), Shadow Rain (Cost: 2), Diomant (Starting Energy: 6), and Giant Arboll (Starting Energy: 6).

        Rala was errata-ed to limit the Wild Blooming effect so that only one of a chosen Paradwyn Creature's Powers can be used a second time per turn, rather than allowing all Powers to be replicated. This change was made because the original ability proved overpowered when combined with cards like K'Teeb, which could copy strong Powers such as those of Fog Hyren and Poison Baloo Root, enabling a single K'Teeb to draw large portions of a deck or discard an entire opposing group of Creatures. The errata restricts this interaction while removing the penalty of discarding the Creature after using Wild Blooming.

        Rala Tail's ability was errata'd to restrict Wild Blooming so that only one of a chosen Paradwyn Creature's Powers can be used a second time per turn, rather than allowing all Powers to be replicated. This change was made because the original effect was overpowered when combined with cards like K'Teeb, which could copy strong Powers such as those of Fog Hyren and Poison Baloo Root, enabling excessive card draw or discarding of opposing Creatures.

        How was Sandswirl affected by errata and why?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Sandswirl was errata'd to prevent it from being played on cards you control, ensuring it could only target opposing Creatures or Magi, as originally intended. It was also changed so that it is no longer discarded after its effect ends, instead remaining in play until removed by another effect (such as Beam of Light). These changes were made because Sandswirl previously allowed players to negate unavoidable drawbacks and created bookkeeping issues due to its discard pile placement. Additionally, its inability to be countered once played made it overpowered compared to other 'Lockdown' effects, leading to widespread use in decks; the errata balanced this by making it both controllable and consistent with game design principles.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Sand Strands was errata'd to fix an unbalancing energy gain issue caused by its original Mirage effect. Originally, players could repeatedly discard Sand Strands to transfer half of a creature's current energy (up to half its printed starting energy) to their Magi while making the chosen creature Illusionary. This allowed players to grow creatures to massive energy levels, then cycle Sand Strands each turn to drain energy without risk, creating an unsustainable advantage. The errata adjusted the effect so that the energy gain is now balanced and directly tied to the Illusionary state—allowing energy transfer only at the cost of making the creature Illusionary, with no repeated abuse through cycling.

        Both Effects have the same trigger in this situation—whenever the Flist attacks (the Flutter Yup)/whenever the Flutter Yup is attacked (by the Flist)—and would therefore resolve in order of the active player and then other players in play order.

        Morag, as errataed, actually has a conflicting wording; he refers to controlling a Relic specifically for your next X turns, then refers to controlling it for only X turns in general.

        It is doing neither.

        Counterattack may not be used until after the attack resolves. If the Creature that attacked is no longer around, then the Rabid Wasperine simply cannot attack anything.

        If I use the D'resh card which allows me to reduce a creature's cost by half, can I use that with an illusionary creature and if so, can it then cost 0 to play?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, if no reduction you apply has a 'minimum of one' stipulation. Whenever you have multiple cost reductions, the highest minimum applies. Example - You play a Creature with a four cost, and have three effects that reduce its cost; one by two, to a minimum of two, one by one, to a minimum of one, and another by one, with no minimum. If you choose to apply the two, then the first 'one' (minimum one) and finally the second 'one', this would happen: a. Four cost reduced to two. b. The 'reduce by one, minimum one' is applied, but as the 'minimum two' barrier has been reached, no reduction can apply. c. Cost attempted to be reduced by another one, but this again fails as the two barrier has been reached.

        With Amulet of Sand in play, when I play a spell, does the Amulet resolve first or the spell?

      <div class="clarification-question">
        In regards to Horizon's Mirage, it states that at the end of your next turn place the creature in play with its starting energy. Current rules have led to confusion where some believe your current turn counts as your next turn, causing Burrow (spell) to cost more and Morag's power to increase. Is this correct?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No such references have been made in rulings past; Horizon's Mirage plays the Creature at the end of your next turn, as it states, meaning your next turn (the turn you have after your current turn). If the Creature cannot legally be played for some reason, Horizon's Mirage is still discarded, and the Creature (with nowhere else to go) is placed in the discard pile.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Such conditions on cards in play do not trigger and resolve; they are static. If a Power costs one additional energy to play and simultaneously costs two less energy to play, as long as the requirements for those changes are met, the end result is the Power costing one less energy to play.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, 'When/Whenever' triggers occur after the card or event in question has resolved.

        How would Karse's Effect Fury affect Tidal Wave when targeting two creatures?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Tidal Wave would not be reduced by Fury because it is a six-cost spell with a secondary effect that costs an additional four energy to discard a second creature during resolution. The total cost of the card remains 10, but the reduction only applies if the entire card's base cost is seven or more energy. Since Tidal Wave's base cost is six, the cost reduction from Fury does not apply.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, she cannot start with two of the same card, and Darkbreed's Minion is an Ash Hyren. Since an Alternate card is considered to have both names in the name box (e.g., "Darkbreed's Minion/Ash Hyren"), being a Hyren makes it illegal to choose for Scyalla’s starting cards due to the Hyren restriction.

        Yes, she can. She may name "Darkbreed", "Minion", or "Ash" as her creature type for Pet Project, since the restriction only prohibits naming "Hyren"; other types—even those that include or encompass Hyrens (like Forest, Ash, Night, Mushroom)—are allowed.

        Crushing Darkness cannot be played by Shadow Magi; Spirit of the Core does not have that restriction, and can be played by all Core Magi, even Shadow Magi. Entombing a regional Spirit would not allow Shadow Magi to play it, though it would stop non-Core Magi of the region from playing it.

        Dakat's Power Deja Vu says: (2) Discard a card from your hand. The next time this turn one of your Spells or Powers removes energy from an opposing Creature, choose another Creature in play. Remove an equal amount of energy from the chosen Creature. How does this work with multi-target Spells like Thunderquake and Stone Storm? If I use Thunderquake to remove 5E from one creature, 3E from another, and 2E from a third, can I then apply Deja Vu three times to choose three new creatures and remove the same amounts of energy? Can I target the same creatures again in different order? Or does Deja Vu only trigger after damage is assigned to the first creature? Does it even work with multi-target Spells like these?
      </div>

        Deja Vu is worded ambiguously; the intent is the next single Creature, and so a Thunderquake (or similar multi-affecting Spell) is not triggered by Deja Vu. If the Thunderquake is discarding energy from only one Creature, then Deja Vu may then amplify it.

        In a game of Dragonshard, if I use Tendril to bring my opponent's Dark Cragnoc to 6 energy and then use Turn to gain control of it, does the Dark Cragnoc return to its starting energy or remain at 6?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Your opponent is correct; Turn does not restore the Cragnoc until you gain control of it, and by then, it would be your card trying to add energy to the Dark Cragnoc, so that part of Turn's effect will be unable to resolve.

        Yes; generally, this is pointless, however, because most every dual-Magi is worthy of that only from their starting energy totals, which are lost because the Spear passes the energy of the Magi using it.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        These effects are not energy loss reduction, but they are energy loss prevention. There are two different scopes of energy loss prevention: Energy loss reduction applies to changes in assigned energy removal after it is assigned (e.g., Burrow, Invulnerability). Energy loss prevention includes both reduction and effects that prevent energy from being discarded (e.g., Resistance, Shell). This is why Piercing does not bypass Resistance, but Fearsome allows energy loss to bypass Shell. Piercing only affects reduction, not full prevention; therefore, the listed effects (Shell, Tranquility, Entangle, Barqua's Bubble) are considered energy loss prevention but not reduction. As such, they are affected by Fearsome’s weakness, but not by Piercing.

        No, the Stagadan may not attack the Magi.

        Neither. Relic Subversion cannot be used if there is a Relic on the Hubra's Cube; Koza does not copy Powers, he just uses Powers as if the Relics were his as well. However, if there wasn't a Relic on the Cube and Relic Subversion was used, you would gain control of the chosen Relic, and the opponent would no longer be able to use Relic Subversion (the one who uses the Power gains control of the Relic, but the Power cannot be used while there is a Relic on top of Hubra's Cube). It must be noted that Koza's Effect doesn't state he copies the Powers, merely that he can use them; this is what causes such potentially strange occurrences.

        Technically, since Fiend of Furoks considers the Furoks to be in her hand, she does not 'search the discard pile' so, yes, she may use Reconstruct, even with a Reality Anchor in play. The same would apply to Brushfire and other similar cards.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        In a combat situation where a Flutter Yup is attacked by an Aerial Flist that gains energy via Charge during the attack, does Dodge prevent energy loss even though the Flist's energy was increased after the attack began? How does the timing of effect resolution work, and has the 'locked in' energy step been removed from the game rules?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Both effects—Charge and Dodge—trigger whenever the Flist attacks or the Flutter Yup is attacked, respectively. Since these triggers are simultaneous, they resolve in order of active player first, then other players in play order. Because it's your turn, Charge resolves first, increasing the Flist's energy to 4E before Dodge resolves. Dodge then prevents the Flutter Yup from losing any energy because the Flist has 4E at the time Dodge checks. There is no longer a separate 'locked in' step for energy totals during combat; instead, card effects evaluate current energy values at the moment they resolve. Cards that reference 'began the attack with' are not functionally different—they serve as reminders of what was true when the attack initiated, but mechanics now rely on real-time evaluation of current states.

        Are Orpus and Furok Guardian being reclarified to 'as' effects, or are the previous rulings allowing them to save creatures from mass discards like Cataclysm now reversed due to standardization of 'when' triggers?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The timing words have never had concrete definitions until now, causing wording issues. Originally, no standardization existed, but over time, certain words became associated with specific timings. Without issuing a full list of clarifications, decisions will rely on common sense for now. Orpus is intended to save the Relic, so it would logically be an 'As' effect if templated today, as waiting until after discard could trigger unwanted enter-play/discard effects. Terra Rebirth waits until the creature is discarded and then returns a new one later, meaning it's not trying to save the original creature; thus, losing the Guardian during a mass discard like Cataclysm would prevent its rebirth. This isn't an absolute rule—tournament judges should use common sense and escalate questions afterward.

        The effects of spirits such as Spirit of Orothe are permanent only as long as the card remains active; if you Interchange the Magi away or otherwise remove it from play (such as by defeating it and using Ritual Spear), then the rules for card memory will cause the changes made by the Spirits to be forgotten.

        No; D'Jarvish cannot return creatures that were defeated in combat to hand because they are not 'specifically discarded from play' by an opposing card.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Spirit Spells except Spirit of Rayje are played after the Magi is defeated and placed in the defeated Magi pile, which allows them to bypass the requirement of having an active Magi. Spirit of Rayje is unique because it is played while the Magi is still active and before defeat, meaning it would be subject to effects like freezing. The wording of most Spirits was intentionally designed to circumvent the 'must have an active Magi' rule to prevent problematic interactions, such as Adis with Spirit of Arderial creating a game-lock situation.

        Does Cawh's ability 'Your cards cannot prevent Cawh from losing energy' mean that effects which would normally reduce or prevent energy loss (like Bubble or Shell) have no effect on Cawh, even if they are not specifically prevented by the card?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Cawh's ability prevents any card from preventing energy loss to Cawh. This means that prevention and reduction effects do not apply to Cawh at all, regardless of whether they would normally affect such losses. The key distinction is that 'do nothing' or 'does not affect' effects never attempt to discard energy in the first place, so there's no energy loss to prevent or reduce. However, Cawh specifically cannot be protected by any card effect that would prevent or reduce energy loss—this includes both prevention and reduction mechanics. The ability is designed to ensure that even if a card like Bubble or Shell attempts to prevent or reduce damage or energy loss, it fails when applied to Cawh. This is not an oversight but intentional playtesting design, as Cawh's resistance to protection is balanced by other constraints.

        Can Dark Furok's Revile trigger to deal 2e damage to Spark Chogo when Flame Spurt and Blast Gloves are used during the attack?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Dark Furok's Revile can trigger. Since Revile says "whenever," any time during an attack that the Dark Furok loses energy, it may Revile, not just when energy is removed normally. The discard from Revile will happen then, possibly defeating an opposing Creature before they can remove energy.

        No, you may not use Blast Gloves' Effect Flame Boost to increase the removal by the Spell Flame Spurt. Flame Boost specifies that it may only be used when a Spell is played that discards energy. Flame Spurt doesn't discard energy when it is played; it just attaches itself at that time.

        No, if Undertow is prevented from discarding the creature, then it does not get to shuffle the creature into its owner's deck. The entire effect of Undertow — including both the discard and the subsequent shuffle — only occurs if the creature is actually discarded.

        Since Haunt says it triggers when a Creature is discarded, it must still be in play after the Creature is discarded. Since Cataclysm discards all non-Magi cards in play, it discards the Haunt before it gets a chance to trigger. While attached cards are normally discarded with what they are attached to, they are not discarded until it's absolutely certain the card will be lost (i.e., it reaches the discard pile), then the attached card leaves play after it.

        If Scyalla names a type with Pet Project, the Swirling Orshaa may change to the referenced type until the end of the turn if it is already in play.

        What does 'discarded from play' mean for creatures, and how is it different from other ways a creature might leave play?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Discarded from play means whenever a card that is in play is moved from play to the discard pile, regardless of the method used to remove it. It refers specifically to when a creature is defeated by an effect that causes it to be sent to the discard pile, such as being destroyed or removed by a spell like Shockwave. This term does not include situations where energy is reduced to zero (like through Thunderquake) unless the card explicitly states it's discarded from play. Cards like Oranragan and Evil Evu are worded clearly to specify this intent; in general, if a card says 'discarded from play,' it means the creature was defeated by an effect that sends it directly to the discard pile.

        While you may place a fourth "sleeved proxy card" (or third for dual magi), you may *not* place an actual magi card there, Ninibom or not. Just use a reverse-sleeved non-Magi Universal card. That way there is no accusation of switching around magi (at least, no more than NOT using the proxy could cause). Also, the proxy should be removed when and if you would be forced to reveal it, such as the case of interchange.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, the Cawh's Effects will be 'shut down', nameless or not. However, because the opponent will have a turn with all of these effects shut off, they will be free to discard, undream, steal, or even just overwhelm the Cawh, so the strategy is not without its risks.

        When do you calculate Thast's energize rate? If he starts the round with 1 Yaromant in play and energizes for 4, then summons 3 more frozen Nar creatures during his summon phase, does his Power (Ice Grinder) discard energy equal to his starting energize of 4 or his current energize of 7 when used in his second PRS phase? What if he decides to flood with energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Thast and similar Magi (whose energize is dependent on a variable) constantly update their totals based on the modifiers in play, i.e., whenever whatever is needed to modify their energize increases or decreases (in this case, frozen Nar creatures), then the energize rate is modified at that exact moment respectively. Whenever energize is referred to, with the rare exception of 'printed energize', you always use the current value.

        Can Sorreah retrieve two Crushing Winds and a Sorreah's Dream as starting cards, and can the Dark Twins obtain two Entomb cards under similar circumstances?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The ruling was correct under specific conditions: if there were two Crushing Winds in the discard pile when Sorreah was flipped, or if no other Arderial Spells existed aside from a Sorreah's Dream, then Sorreah may retrieve both copies. Sorreah does not allow direct searching of the deck for Arderial Spells; instead, you must first attempt to retrieve them from the discard pile, and only if insufficient cards remain in the discard pile may you search the deck. While it is theoretically possible for Sorreah to obtain three Sorreah's Dreams, this scenario is highly unlikely unless Sorreah is the first Magi chosen. In contrast, the Dark Twins are very likely to retrieve two Entomb cards as starting cards if they choose to do so, especially since they typically select their starting cards first.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        It would cost one additional energy to choose each creature, totaling three additional energy in all. The additional cost is added to each instance of choosing one creature, not based on the literal phrase "choose one creature," as that would require "choose ONLY one creature."

        When effects trigger 'when' an action occurs, they resolve after that action has fully resolved.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Playing a Creature and taking control of a Creature are separate things; however, this scenario is not currently possible. What's more likely to happen would be playing a Sareb while the opponent only has a Cawh; in this case, nothing prevents you from giving them control of the Sareb, because they do not have to play it to gain control of it.

        Can Spirit of Rayje be played on my turn to simply add three energy to my magi, or is it only playable when an opposing card discards all energy from my magi?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Spirit of Rayje may only be played when an opposing card discards all of the energy from your magi; this condition is the sole means by which the card can be played, and it cannot be used on your turn to simply add three energy.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The 'discard the chosen creature's energy' part of Alaban's Undream power is extraneous reminder text and should be ignored; the rules for card memory automatically remove energy counters. Cawh negates the return-to-hand effect just as it would any other such ability.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        If a non-discardable relic can be chosen by Frost Raxis, does this bypass its "cannot be discarded" ability since the discard is indirect (chosen by the opponent rather than directly caused by Frost Raxis)?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Though the opponent is allowed to choose what is discarded, Thermal Stress is still the source of the discard effect; this means that if the Relic the opponent chooses cannot be discarded by opposing cards, it ignores Thermal Stress's discard effect. Additionally, because Thermal Stress needs to reference a Relic that was actually discarded from play by the Power, not just a Relic that was attempted to be discarded by it, even if the opponent tries (and fails) to discard one of these 'legendary' Relics, the Raxis will not gain the energy from using Thermal Stress if the Relic's not the one you chose.

        You have a Giant Carillion and a K'Teeb Cub with 4e on it in play. Your opponent uses Nar and Frozen to freeze all creatures. You use K'Teeb Cub's power, which normally allows Giant Carillion to use its power for free. Since all creatures are frozen, does Giant Carillion still have to spend 1e to use its power?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, the Giant Carillion would still cost 1 energy to use its power. Although the K'Teeb Cub reduces the cost of Stomp to zero, the frozen status imposes a separate 1-energy penalty that is not affected by cost reductions. The frozen effect changes the base cost calculation such that even if the original cost (X) is reduced to zero, the +1 energy penalty from being frozen still applies.

        M'Rika would 'forget' that she is a Shadow Magi and when she enters play again, she will be purely Orothe (and in a lot of trouble if she has no cards to play).

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        True, Niffer could play Core, Shadow Aderial, and Orothe cards. As both Nagsis's Possession and Allies are effects triggered by the revealing of Niffer, you would choose the order to apply them. If you applied Allies first, she would end up being an Arderial Shadow Magi as well as a Shadow Magi of the region named. If you applied Possession first, then Niffer would be Arderial and the region named. The final result of these changes is permanent as long as Niffer remains in play. Regardless of what type of Magi she ends up being, as long as Allies is active, she will only be able to play cards from Arderial, Universal, and the region named.

        Either creature could be chosen to lose energy from the Flame Spurt, but in either case, the effects of their abilities (Pack Hunt and Shield) would prevent them from losing energy in the attack.

        If my opponent uses a Crushing spell on my 4e creature, and I choose to have Sagawal sacrifice itself instead of my other creature being discarded, does that cancel out the effect of the Crushing spell?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Sagawal may be discarded when one of your creatures is reduced to zero energy by a spell, 'instead' of the creature; however, the creature will still be at zero energy and discarded anyway. But the source of this discard will then be the game rules, not the card effect that reduced the creature to zero energy. So while it would generally be a waste to discard Sagawal when another creature is reduced to zero energy and discarded, it will 'erase' the effects of the Crushing spell (or any card with a similar 'if this effect discards the chosen creature from play') and prevent your opponent from gaining the secondary benefit.

        You were correct; the Jungle Hyren could not gain the benefits of Liriel's Cape or its own Dreamwarp ability, because Liriel's Cape only affects Creatures in play (and a Creature is not in play at the point you would pay for Dreamwarping changes), and the Jungle Hyren has to be in play in order to use its version of the Dreamwarp Effect (and it is not in play to use the effect while it is being played).

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Treat Cawh as if he had the following: Cawh (First Nameless Effect): If Cawh is discarded or returned to your hand by an opposing card while it has energy, discard six energy from Cawh instead. Opposing cards cannot make Cawh change controllers. The opponent would receive Cawh, but you would not receive it back later because Arosa would then be an opposing card trying to take control of Cawh.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You could not play the Mantle, because Sorreah is an Arderial Magi and it is a d'Resh Relic. In the case of Redream, Sorreah would only be able to take a Sorreah's Dream, and Scyalla would only be able to take a Weave Powder, because these are the only printed starting cards they have.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        I read in a previous Rules Digest that a frozen magi would not be able to play a Spirit card when defeated since they would not be able to pay the additional energy. I find this confusing due to the timing word 'when.' Since it seems you can only play this spell after your magi has been defeated (and the defeat has been resolved) you would have no magi in play. If you have no magi in play then you would not have a frozen magi, and would not have to pay an additional energy.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The only Spirit Spell that cannot be played by a frozen Magi is Spirit of Rayje, because it is played before the Magi leaves play. You are correct about the other Spirits, though, there is no Magi to be frozen.

        I also read that a non-Core magi would not be able to cast a Spirit spell that had been chosen by Entomb (and, by extension, a Core magi would not be able to cast Spirit of the Core if it had been chosen by Cleansing). I find this confusing, also because of the timing word 'when.' If there is no magi in play it would seem that there would be no magi to check for regional penalties and restrictions.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Technically speaking, playing a Spirit Spell ignores regional restrictions, because there is no Magi playing it (these are the ONLY cards currently that can be played without an active Magi, and having a zero cost means you can pay the zero energy to play them). A Core Magi could not play an Entombed Spirit of Arderial when they're defeated, because the Spirit requires an Arderial Magi be defeated, not the Magi of the Spell's region; but, a Cleansed Spirit of the Core could be played when a Core Magi is defeated, because its requirement is that a Core Magi be defeated, and there are no regional penalties to come into play.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Will of Orothe now attaches to an opposing Magi. If it remains attached during that Magi's Attack step, you choose whether or not that Magi's Creatures attack and which Creatures they attack, with the restriction that a Creature may not attack another Creature controlled by the same player. Discard Will of Orothe at the beginning of your next turn. The reasoning for this change is to address the abuse caused by the Will/Entangle combo, which allowed indefinite stalling in unfair combo decks. Previously, both Will and Entangle affected the opponent rather than their Magi, making suppression nearly unstoppable. This revision aligns the card with modern design intent by targeting the Magi directly and allowing the effect to be dispelled, thus preventing infinite control loops.

        Creeping Chill: Until the end of your next turn, as one of your Kybar's Teeth Creatures is attacked, it gains three energy if you control at least one Bograth Creature, and as one of your Bograth Creatures attacks, it gains three energy if you control at least one Kybar's Teeth Creature. Reasoning: Because of unfair abuse with Overwrite-style abilities, players were able to intentionally misuse Creeping Chill to the detriment of their environment. This change to the Spell enables it to continue being a combat booster for Bograth/Kybar's Teeth decks, but not in a way that can be overly abused.

        If Sarazen Outcast's Favored Enemy is D'Resh (or Kybar's Teeth) and it attacks a Sandstone Hyren, which has Super Invulnerability (loses two less energy from attacks and loses no energy from effects during any player's attack), would it lose any energy from the Sarazen Outcast's effect Bane (add four energy before energy is removed when in an attack with its Favored Enemy)? Example: Sarazen Outcast is at 3 energy, Sandstone Hyren is at 9. Would the SC end the battle dead, having done 5 total damage to the SH or just 1?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Sarazen Outcast’s Effect does not do anything to any other Creatures. The Outcast in your example would attack, gaining four energy, and would then be at seven energy. Combat between the two Creatures is handled normally. In the example, it would remove five energy (7 – 2) from the Hyren, and the Hyren would remove nine energy from the Outcast (defeating it).

What about if Vertigo was cast—does the penalty from Vertigo apply when playing the Snow Barl Pup and then return to the Magi?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, you can use Phrup to stop a Snow Barl Pup that is played using its Effect. You may use Phrup’s "Time Lapse" any time an opponent plays a card. If your opponent paid no energy to play the Time Lapsed card (for example, if they Dreamdraft a Snow Barl Pup using a Nar Magi), then no energy is returned to that Magi. If that player paid energy to play that card (for example, if they Dreamdraft a Snow Barl Pup using a non-Nar Magi), that much energy is returned to that player’s Magi; this includes all cost increases (like regional penalties) or reductions (like robes of the ages). Vertigo only affects a Magi on that Magi’s Player’s turn. It does not increase the cost of cards played by that Player on anyone else’s turn. Snow Barl Pup, when played using its effect "Dreamdraft," ignores all costs. If its cost would somehow be increased, it would ignore the increased cost.

        How do regional penalties work for Universal Magi? Can they just summon whatever they want without penalty?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Universal Magi are from their own region, which is a jack-of-all-trades and yet a master of none. They must pay a regional penalty for all non-Universal cards while non-Universal Magi continue to have no penalty for Universal cards. The Universal 'region' is what the Eliwan wielded initially from the time they started using the magic of the Moonlands. It is the basis for which all magic of the Moonlands is founded; later on, different regional founders and elders tempered the practices and learnings of the Eliwan to tailor their own distinct styles of magic, encompassing the summoning of non-Universal Dream Creatures as well. While regional Magi had to learn the Eliwan teachings as a foundation for their more specialized, regional-specific forms of magic, Universal Magi never fully graduated beyond the initial Eliwan teachings, either by choice (Rayje), lack of access (Tuku), or lack of practice (Tony Jones).

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, the definition of Move is 'discard X energy to add X energy.' In this case, Energy Substitution turns the energy discard into an energy gain.

        Does Sandsifter's unnamed effect have the ability to prevent Sandsifter from dying in combat?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No; the effect cannot prevent Sandsifter from dying in combat because energy cannot be retroactively added. The effect only activates after the process of discarding Sandsifter has already begun, specifically when moving to the step of discarding it from play. Since the effect can only negate current influences on Sandsifter, it can stop the discard caused by an opposing card reducing its energy to zero—but not the subsequent discard triggered by game rules due to having zero energy. After the opposing card's influence is negated, Sandsifter remains with zero energy in play, which triggers a discard via rule effect without any source affecting it, leading to its removal from play.

        When cards like Bagala Fangs say 'change a creature's starting energy to 10 or 1, does that mean the energy actually on the card or the number printed on the card? For instance, if you have a Bagala Hunter in play at 4 energy and activate Bagala Fangs, does it now have 10 energy or still 4? Can you bring a creature's starting energy down to one and then use Yark Yark Gloves on them?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        "Downs" (or "Shriveled Dreams") sets Quido Swarm's starting energy to one when the power is used. However, "Calling" continually sets the Swarm's energy to be equal to the number of Bograth and Paradwyn creatures in play. Calling has precedence.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, this is legal. Although cards lose their memory of effects when they leave play, the starting energy value is checked and locked in at the time the Power is activated.

        Can Barqua's Bubble protect Cawh from spells like Dessicate or Sandswirl, and can it protect Cawh from Shockwave given that Cawh's effect changes a Shockwave's discard to energy loss?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Barqua's Bubble cannot protect Cawh from Dessicate because Cawh's first effect states 'other cards cannot prevent Cawh from losing energy.' Sandswirl does not discard energy, it only increases the amount of energy discarded in attacks, so Barqua's Bubble can stop Sandswirl from affecting Cawh. Barqua's Bubble can protect Cawh from Shockwave because you may choose to resolve the Bubble before Cawh's protective effect. If Cawh is losing six energy to prevent a discard effect, that energy loss occurs due to Cawh's own effect, not from an opposing card.

        In the most recent RD, it was stated that Will of Orothe cannot be staffed as it affects the player and the Magi. But, as per the errata attaching WoO to a Magi is the first step, does this not make it Staffable?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Once again, The correct Errata on Will of Orothe is: Will of Orothe - Orothe Spell - 6 - Attach Will of Orothe to an opposing Magi. While Will of Orothe is attached, that Magi's Creatures may not use Powers. During that Magi's Attack step, you choose whether or not that Magi's Creatures attack and what they attack. A Creature may not attack another Creature or Magi controlled by the same player. Discard Will of Orothe at the beginning of your next turn. Attaching a card to a Magi does not inherently affect the Magi. Will of Orothe does not affect the Magi, because it does not in any way alter the game state of the Magi; it instead affects the Magi's player, the Magi is needed so that the Will has a 'point of reference' to see which player it's supposed to affect, but it's never directly interacted with by the Spell. It also affects the Magi's Creatures, "That magi's creature's may not use powers." Will of Orothe is not 'staff-able'.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        At the beginning of your turn, your creature and your magi would each lose 1 energy. Your magi would be defeated. You would not get to flip your next magi. All events (game rules, Magi flipping, or effects) trigger at the same time—specifically at the beginning of your turn. Then the active player processes their effects and game events in the order they choose. In this case, the active player has none. Then the inactive player processes their effects in the order they choose. Here, the effect on the attached Tar Hyren triggers.

        This question is about the card Furok Protector. The card says: Effect - Thick Coat When you play Furok Protector, choose an opposing Magi. Set Furok Protector's energy equal the chosen Magi's energize. Say Player A plays a Furok Protector. Player's B magi is Fiend of Furoks (energize rate 6). Furok Protector's energy is now 6. My question is does the three extra energy come from player's A magi, player's B magi, or neither?

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Ninx would be able to use Stare Down again during her next turn. The Climbing Staff only negates the specific instance of the Power or effect it targets, making that single use do nothing.

        No; the rules of Magi defeat for having no energy in play require all pending Spells and other effects to resolve before the Magi is discarded from play. Bloom doesn't resolve until the Power it allows you to use resolves, so Ninx would get her Stare Down before being defeated.

        Glorious Prophecy defeats an opposing magi. However, Kyg'n's effect states that he "is not defeated", even if he normally would be, until he is directly attacked while in a state that would normally indicate his defeat. Whereas direct defeat affects circumvent the defeat rules by ignoring them and removing the Magi anyway, True Grit takes it one step higher and adds an additional requirement to defeat, no matter how it may occur.

        No; the caveat to the move mechanic is that it will not add energy if none was literally discarded, because move mechanics are not 'discard THEN add', they are 'discard TO add'. Though the energy amount that Energy Substitution changed from discard to add was intended as discard, it did not literally discard, so that amount is not added during the 'add X energy' part of the move mechanic, where 'X' is the amount actually discarded.

        Attaching a card to something does not necessarily affect it. You can attach Sunburn (and other non-Arderial Spells) to a Lovian.

Sunburn does not affect the Creature it is attached to, it only changes the amount of energy removed by other cards. It will work normally while attached to a Lovian. In the case of Haunt, the Lovian will be returned to play on the Haunt’s controller’s side because Resistance only applies when the Lovian is in play. However, the Lovian will not become Core and can attack on the same turn it returns to play. This is because the changing of region and the cannot-attack-this-turn parts of Haunt occur while the Lovian is in play – Resistance applies.

        No. Magma Parmalag’s Power affects Creatures that come into play after it has been used. Unless you are required to choose a Creature in play (Agram’s Armor), or the card has been clarified to state otherwise (like Shadow Cloak), cards that affect your Creatures for a stated duration will apply to those that come into play after it has been used until the specified duration has elapsed.

      <div class="clarification-answer">

        After your attack step you still have a minimum of 15 on your current Magi. You play a Gorath. You then proceed to take control of a player's creature using the Gorath's power. Once you've obtained your opponent's creature, you play a Shadow Rain on the stolen Creature. This leaves your Magi with zero energy, and two creatures in play. On your opponent's turn, they quickly finish off your Gorath, thus gaining control of their creature again and defeating your Magi. The question at hand is will your opponent's Creature that had the Shadow Rain played on it leave play at the end of your opponent's next Attack phase? If not, will it leave play at the end of your next Attack phase?

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Shadow Rain does not require that your Magi remain the same or that you retain control of the Creature in order to work.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        Based on the most recent clarification, is the 'Move' effect considered distinct from 'discard' and 'add', allowing it to circumvent damage prevention/reduction effects (like Pylofuf or Baby Furok) and bypass restrictions on gaining energy (like Deep Wellisk), since it's not classified as a standard discard or add?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Move means "Discard energy from one card to add as much energy as was discarded to another card." This counts as both energy loss/discard and energy gain/addition. It will interact normally with cards that trigger on either adding or removing energy (like Forest Hyren’s 'Underbrush' or Amanax’s 'Pyromaniac') or those that prevent either adding or removing energy (like Tryn, Flame-Saver’s unnamed effect or Pylofuf’s 'Burrow'). 'Rearrange' is different from 'move' – 'Rearrange' is not considered energy removal/discard or energy gain/addition. The 'rearrange' mechanic is only found on two cards: Flame Control and Gift of the Weave.

        Since cards that are regionally changed by effects like Scyalla aren't actually changed until they are played, how does Entomb fit into this? If Entomb only changes the card when it is played, then Cleansing wouldn't be able to return an entombed spell to the light side, and Entomb couldn't prevent a non-Core opponent from playing their good spells since those spells would still be non-Core until cast. Is this correct?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Entomb and Cleansing change the printed region of the named card. This change applies immediately (not just when the named cards are played), and applies to copies of the named cards in any hand, deck, discard pile, or cards in play.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Rockslide Hyren’s Power will operate normally until after energy has been removed. If this loss of energy would discard Sandsifter from play, you can then use its Effect to save it by discarding another Oracle from play. If you do, Sandsifter will not be discarded from play by Rockslide Hyren’s Power – however, it will still be at zero energy and will be immediately discarded from play by the game rules.

        A Creature with a printed starting energy of 5 that has Dreamwarp can be played for 4, 5, or 6 energy. If you pay 6, it will come into play with 6 energy. Until the end of the turn, any cards that check that Creature’s starting energy value (Dream Balm, Ookami’s Drums, etc.) will treat that Creature as if its starting energy were 6 instead of 5. At the end of the turn, the Creature’s starting energy value reverts back to 5 (its printed starting energy value). This does not add or remove energy from the Creature.

        With my final two energy I play a Lesser Darbok, with defend I choose my Sikra an illusionary creature. The following turn a Wasperine is played and attacks my Lesser Darbok which defeats it. This now triggers Tangle, which now has my Lesser Darbok attached to the Wasperine. Now here's the problem: Check to see if the creature is defeated, well the Lesser Darbok still has no energy on it. So it's defeated again. If this is the case, Tangle does nothing.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Lesser Darbok's Effects should read as follows: Effect - Defend: When you play Lesser Darbok, choose one of your other Creatures in play. While Lesser Darbok has energy, the chosen Creature cannot be attacked. Effect - Tangle: If Lesser Darbok is defeated while defending, attach Lesser Darbok to the attacking Creature. While Lesser Darbok is attached, other cards cannot affect it and it cannot be discarded from play for having zero energy. The Creature it is attached to cannot attack.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The rules for Magi defeat are stated in a slightly misleading manner in the rulebook; Magi are defeated specifically when they have no energy in play (as Illusionary Creatures do not count for purposes of Magi defeat, they are treated as having 0E), not generally when they have no Creature cards in play and no energy themselves.

        Attacking the Lesser Darbok (which I'm assuming you can do because it's still in play) defeats the Lesser Darbok again, transferring his Tangle to the new creature.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        "Play" refers to the action of taking a card from an out-of-play area—such as your hand, deck, or discard pile—and putting it into the playing area. It does not mean that cards in your deck or hand are permanently changed. Instead, when you play a Creature of the chosen type, it becomes a Weave Creature only at the moment it is brought into play and remains so while in play. This timing means that effects like Marella's Starting Card ability do not trigger because retrieving starting cards does not count as "playing" a card.

        Hi, recently my friend and I were playing a game where he had two Vraks in play and one other 3 energy creature. I killed the 3 energy creature, leaving the two Vraks. My question is, are both Vraks discarded because of its effect? It states that if Vrak is the only Nar creature in play then its discarded. Technically, since there are 2 Vraks in play, it IS the only Nar creature in play, so are they discarded?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        By stating Vrak, it is self referential. In other words, two Vraks are two separate Nar Creatures, and neither will be discarded from the Effect. If multiple Vraks were to all be discarded, the Effect would have to read "If Vrak is your only non-Vrak Nar Creature in play, discard it."

        Yes, you may; at the time the effect is triggered, the energy has not yet been removed, only assigned to be removed.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Both resolve normally; being the active player, your Haunt resolves and you play the Darbok, then the Darbok is attached to the Creature that defeated it (defeat effects do not require the Creature to reach the discard pile, only that it be reduced to zero energy), and all other stipulations for Tangle apply, meaning your Creature cannot attack as long as the Darbok is attached, and the Darbok cannot be affected by other cards or be discarded from play for having zero energy. The opponent can still erase this protection by removing the attached Creature from play. Also, to put this to rest before it can get out of hand, a touch-up to the recent Lesser Darbok clarification: Effect - Tangle: If Lesser Darbok is defeated while defending, attach Lesser Darbok to the attacking Creature. While Lesser Darbok is attached, it cannot be involved in an attack, other cards cannot affect it, and it cannot be discarded from play for having zero energy. The Creature it is attached to cannot attack.

        Can a Sunglare Celphet reflect mass damage spells like Wildfire and Flamegeyser, given the wording 'when energy is removed from one of your creatures' as opposed to using the word -Only-?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You may mirror the removal from the mass removal, but only to and from a single source, i.e., if a Flame Geyser were played and affected three of your Creatures and your Magi, you could only choose the removal from one of your cards (3E) and apply it to an opposing card.

        Can anything bypass Tranquility's protection?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes; Tranquility is a reduction effect, meaning that, for instance, Rayje's Sword can pierce it. This is because Tranquility does not affect energy loss until after it has been assigned, then changes the amount to be discarded to zero. Prevention, on the other hand, does not even allow energy loss to be assigned (the Effect - Resistance is a common example). Tranquility states that cards that 'all Spells, Powers, and Effects that discard energy instead discard no energy', so the loss is still assigned in the form of removal, then is reduced to zero before it becomes actual energy discard.

        All card effects that mention Starting Cards, such as the effect Starfire or the spell Redream, will only affect named cards printed on the Magi, or cards with "Starting: Magi" printed on the cards. They will never affect chosen starting cards such as "any one spell."

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes; Vogo's effect Interrupt activates "whenever an opposing Spell or Power CHOOSES only one of your other Creatures in play," which is well before the Spell or Power resolves, and therefore well before any energy loss is allocated.

        What does 'frozen' mean in the game when using D'resh and Nar decks?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        "Frozen" is a status that is inflicted by certain Nar cards such as Essence of Frost, Yaromant, and Zyavu. These cards generally have the "Arctic" descriptor in their title under their name, and often freeze all of one category of card (such as All Creatures). While a card is frozen, all Powers on that card cost one additional energy to use. If a Magi is frozen, in addition to their Powers costing one more, Spells cost the frozen Magi one additional energy to play. The effects of being Frozen are always listed in the un-named Effect on the card which inflicts the Frozen status. See Essence of Frost for an example of an Arctic card.

        In a scenario where Player A's Yark (5 Energy) attacks Player B's Speag (4 Energy, 2 above starting), with Speag having Watch & Weave, Rehyla-Magi’s Counter-Weave ability, and Yark having Diving Attack, in what order do the abilities resolve, how much energy does each creature have when combat starts, and who wins?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        First, all effects that trigger when Speag is attacked are evaluated. Since they share the same trigger, the active player (Player A) resolves their effect first: Yark's Diving Attack reduces Speag to 2 Energy. Then, Player B (defending player) chooses the order to resolve their effects: Counter-Weave, Watch, and Weave. Assuming Weave is not used, Watch adds 2 Energy to Speag and Counter-Weave adds 1 Energy to Speag, bringing it to 5 Energy total. Counter-Weave also reduces Yark by 1 Energy (to 4). During combat resolution, Speag loses 4 Energy (from the fight), leaving it at 1 Energy, while Yark loses 5 Energy and is discarded due to exceeding its energy capacity. Therefore, Speag survives with 1 Energy, and Player B wins.

        How does invulnerability work in combat? Specifically, what happens when a 5 energy creature with invulnerability attacks a 6 energy creature with no invulnerability, and vice versa?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        It's just like a normal attack, except that you subtract the Invulnerability (usually loses one less energy) from the amount of energy the invulnerable creature loses. If a 5e creature with Invulnerability of 1 attacks a normal 5e creature, both will try to remove 5e, but the invulnerable creature will only end up losing 4e (5 inflicted minus the one from Invulnerability), surviving with 1e, while the normal creature will lose the full 5e and be discarded.

        If an opponent plays a creature with multiple regions, and one of them matches the Bograth Magi's region (Eryss), does Eryss's Discordia effect trigger? For example, if a Paradwyn player uses a Mydra (Bograth/Paradwyn) on Eryss’s turn, does it count as a non-Bograth creature for Discordia purposes?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Magi is named Eryss, and the effect is Discordia. Discordia will not trigger unless the Creature shares NO regions with the Magi; therefore, if a Paradwyn player plays a Mydra (Bograth/Paradwyn), it is treated as a Paradwyn creature played by a Paradwyn Magi in this case, so Discordia does not trigger.

        Are ongoing effects considered 'effects' for the purposes of cards that cancel, alter, or are triggered by effects?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        An ongoing effect is simply a card effect that persists beyond the life of the card; while generally unrelated to other types of effects, it is possible for an effect to create an ongoing effect (such as a triggered effect requiring actions at the beginning of a turn, which resolves based on compliance even if the card is discarded).

        In a 3-player game with Andy (Nar), Tony (d'Resh), and Sean (Core), Sean plays Haunt on a Sand Hyren. Andy then plays Shockwave to discard the Hyren. Can Tony play Forgotten Songs to save his Hyren, or does Haunt trigger first?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Haunt triggers first because it states 'When that Creature is discarded, play it INSTEAD,' which activates as the creature is being discarded. Forgotten Songs allows you to put a creature into your hand instead of the discard pile when one of your creatures is being discarded by another card. Since Haunt affects the creature during the discard process and occurs before Forgotten Songs can act on the discarded card, Haunt resolves first and prevents Forgotten Songs from being played.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Short Fuse will be triggered for each single instance of your card being discarded under the proper conditions, so if a Beam of Light discards two of your other Relics, Short Fuse would discard two energy from the opposing Magi. Cataclysm discards all non-Magi cards simultaneously.

        Agram's Staff does not change the region of a card at all; it changes the ruleset you use for playing certain cards. The Dark Twins and Cleansing are missing from this list. The wording of the effect that causes the change of region determines whether one or both regions are replaced; for example, Cleansing states "the card becomes the chosen region instead of Core," so a dual Bograth/Core card would become a dual Bograth/Underneath or Kybar's Teeth card.

      </div>

        Cataclysm can only be prevented from being played by effects that stop it from being cast or resolved entirely. The 'Opposing cards do not affect Cataclysm' clause applies only to effects that would alter or counter the spell after it's been played. Sandsifter's ability does not prevent Cataclysm from being played, so it still resolves fully. Since Sandsifter is discarded as part of Cataclysm's effect (which occurs before the spell begins resolving), you may discard one of your Oracles, and the Sandsifter will remain in play while all other non-Magi cards are discarded. You can apply this for any number of Sandsifters you control.

        Yes, in this odd situation your Magi would be defeated before energizing, as the Energize Step happens after the beginning of turn.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The following cards need a transitional clarification to their wordings:

Furok: Effect - Retrieve: As a defending Creature removes energy from Furok, place half that energy, rounded up, back on your Magi.

Orok: Effect - Undermine: As Orok loses energy in an attack, choose any one Magi in play. Discard half as much energy as Orok loses from the chosen Magi, rounded down.

Dark Furok: Effect - Revile: As Dark Furok attacks and loses energy, discard half that amount of energy, rounded down, from any one Creature in play.

Mowat: Effect - Prickly: As an opposing Creature removes energy from Mowat, remove one energy from that Creature.

Drought: there seems to have been some confusion over the effect of Drought's wording; for the sake of ease, its text may be treated as saying 'The next time each player energizes, none of that player's cards gains energy from energizing.'

      <div class="clarification-question">
        Given the wording of Scroll of Fire, does a spell or power need to physically discard an energy before Pyromancy takes effect? If effects like Arderian Guard Wings, Weave Hut, or Stumbling Junjertrug reduce the discard to zero, would Scroll of Fire still take effect?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Arderian Guard Wings and Scroll of Fire have the same trigger: 'when <something> discards energy from <something>'. The active player's effect resolves first, typically the player with Scroll of Fire. Scroll of Fire adds one additional energy to the amount discarded by the spell, and then Arderian Guard Wings reduces that total by two.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        Does Drought prevent the flipped Magi from energizing?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Drought negates the next Energize 'action' performed by each player on their cards in play at the time the action takes place, not the cards that are in play at the time of Drought's casting. An Energize 'action' happens for a player when they must Energize all of their cards in play that can be Energized, meaning either 1-Energize step or 2-Flood of Energy. So even if a Magi plays Drought on their first turn before the opponent even reveals a Magi, the opponent's Magi will not Energize on their next turn; similarly, if that Magi flips and defeats the Magi that cast Drought, the Drought player's next Magi will still not get to Energize when they flip.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Crushing Heat affects the Magi after the Creature is discarded from play, at which time you may use Clover's Effect (which, due to its ability to make your cards unaffected, should be treated like an 'as' effect).

        When discarding a card for the Lens of Truth's power that is less than the starting energy of an illusion in your hand but greater than the illusion's cost after being reduced by its illusionary effect, could you process the illusionary effect first before checking for casting costs within the Lens of Truth's reduction range, thus reducing the illusion's cost by an additional 2 energy? Specifically, if I discard a Bulabantu with the Lens, would a Xala cost a total of 2 or 4?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Xala will cost two, because Lens specifies "energy cost" rather than the more standard "printed cost", which means it will take into account all modifiers to the 'cost to play' value before kicking in. It isn't an Effect, it's a duration Power, so it goes last in the chain.

        If the rule book states that your magi may start with 'any' or 'all' of their starting cards, does this mean a player can choose to start with only one of Scyalla's two different non-Hyren creatures, even if she goes first in the magi stack? And if she were placed second or third and there are no two creatures in your discard or deck that share a type, would you still be able to grab only one creature?

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Scyalla can indeed grab only one Creature, as long as it is a non-Hyren creature. The restriction that the second Creature must be a different creature of the same type applies only when selecting a second Creature. Just as Sorreah and Tony can grab any Arderial Spell or Creature respectively, but must choose from one in the discard if any exist, Scyalla's first non-Hyren Creature must come from the discard.

        Lava Flow ignores the energy loss cap set by Burrow.

Note, however, that Lava Flow only ignores Burrow's cap if the cap is already in place.

        The second Rayjes Cloak you played overrides the first one because it specifically prevents opposing cards from stopping your abilities.

Although Haunt's effect triggers when the creature is dealt fatal damage, all effects that would alter this outcome resolve simultaneously, and the defending player (KT) chooses the order in which they resolve.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Orothe player was correct; they should have paid 2e. The calculation is as follows: Tidal Wave has a base cost of 6e. The freeze penalty adds 1e, bringing the total to 7e. This triggers Karse's Effect Fury, reducing the cost by 3e (7e - 3e = 4e). Then, Maelstrom Flask reduces the remaining cost by half (4e / 2 = 2e).

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When Beam of Light destroys Frusk, you do not draw a card because Frusk's ability only triggers if it is destroyed by a spell or power that causes damage; since Beam of Light does not cause damage, the effect does not trigger.

        What is the difference between a triggered response and an ongoing effect?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        A triggered response occurs when a specific event happens (such as a creature being destroyed or energy being added), causing an immediate effect to happen at that time. An ongoing effect remains active as long as certain conditions are met, such as a card staying in play with continuous abilities like "gains 1 energy whenever another creature gains energy."

        Yes, Yaki can still play Core cards. Although he becomes a Naroom Shadow Magi and is affected by the penalties of Tainted Touch, his ability to play Naroom cards without penalty or with a two-point penalty allows him to ignore the effects of Tainted Touch when playing those cards, including Core cards.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Forest Hyren cannot gain extra energy from Underbrush in this case. The effect triggers only when a spell or power adds energy to Forest Hyren; restoring energy via Weebo’s ability does not count as "adding" energy and therefore does not trigger Underbrush.

        Furok Protector comes into play with energy equal to the opposing Magi's Energize rate. Since you’ve just defeated the enemy Magi, their Energize rate applies when Furok Protector enters play; therefore, it does not come in with 0E and is fully playable.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Emaya's effect is a continuous checking effect that activates at the beginning of each of her turns. When she chooses an opponent, her Energize increases by one for each relic that opponent currently has in play. This bonus persists as long as the condition remains true—meaning if the chosen opponent gains more relics during her turn (e.g., via another card's effect), her Energize increases immediately. However, the bonus only applies while she controls the relevant relics and is active on her turn. If a relic leaves play or she switches opponents, the energize value adjusts accordingly. The effect does not stack indefinitely because it’s tied to current conditions and doesn’t create lasting permanent bonuses.

Opposing cards may not gain control of your Relics and other Creatures.' With this corrected text, Relic Stalker cannot discard a Relic because it does not specifically affect Relics or Creatures; however, Beam of Light targeting two Relics (including Osatch) or a Relic and another Creature will be prevented if the card specifically targets Relics or Creatures. Thus, only effects that explicitly target Relics or Creatures are blocked by Osatch.

        When two Vraks are in play, each Vrak's ability triggers whenever the other becomes tapped or untapped, creating a loop where they continually trigger each other’s abilities.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If the creature's power says to discard ITSELF, and the power cost brings it to zero, then yes, it can still discard itself as part of the power (Core Grag, etc). If the creature's power says to CHOOSE a creature (usually to discard it, such as Deep Hyren, or add energy to it, such as Xyx Minor), and the power cost brings it to zero, then no, the creature will be discarded when it reaches zero energy, before you reach the stage where you make choices for the power.

        How does Cataclysm interact with opposing cards that normally affect spells or creatures?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Cataclysm cannot be affected by opposing cards that modify its wording, region, or cost, meaning effects like Umm...No!, Barqua's Bubble, Emec's Forge, or Sandsifter's ability do not prevent Cataclysm from resolving. These cards only protect creatures after the effect resolves, but since Cataclysm discards all creatures simultaneously, none can be saved by such protections. The key point is that opposing cards must affect Cataclysm 'as it is being played'—such as changing its cost or wording—to have an impact, which most protective effects do not do.

        Can Sandsifter use its ability to discard an Oracle when it would be defeated in combat, thereby preventing loss of energy and avoiding discarding from play?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Sandsifter can use its effect when it would be defeated in combat by discarding another Oracle from play, which prevents it from being discarded due to the attack's energy loss. However, Sandsifter will still be at zero energy after the combat and will immediately be discarded from play according to game rules. This means that while the ability saves Sandsifter from immediate discard caused by the combat, it does not prevent eventual removal due to having zero energy. This rule applies similarly to other effects that remove energy from Sandsifter, especially relevant for Crushing spells.

Can Speag attack in this case? What about a creature that was Crystallized or stolen with Crushing Darkness? Which effect takes precedence—general (like Empress Gia) or specific effects like 'this creature cannot attack'?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        We have 3 Levels of Specific-ness. General (like Rayje's Boots), Specific (Like Mantle of Shadows), and Magi-Specific (Any effect that specifically refers to the Magi like Kesia). Magi-Specific overrules everything, and Specific overrules General. In almost all cases this specificity really only applies to actions/Effects that set up some kind of durational state. Empress Gia states 'If you have Core cards in play, all of your Creatures may attack, even those that cannot normally attack.' (Per clarification, Empress Gia is not to be included when checking to see if either her Effects triggers.) She specifically overrides any ongoing inability to attack, per card text (such as Speag or Crystallize), but does not override any one-shot limited-duration specific effects (such as Crushing Darkness).

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The outcome depends on which Bungaloo your opponent chose. If they played the same Bungaloo that was discarded and defeated, it is already in play by the end of their turn, so Furok Guardian's effect cannot return it again. If they chose a different copy of Bungaloo from your discard pile, then the original Bungaloo will still return to play at the end of your turn as normal. In case of dispute over which creature was chosen, presume the one nearest the top of the discard pile was selected. Note that the Bungaloo can be returned to play from any out-of-play area—hand, deck, or discard—and only fails to return if it is already in play.

        The 'Weave' ability triggers both when a creature attacks and when it is attacked. Although newer cards use the phrase "whenever _____ is in an attack" instead of "whenever _____ attacks or is attacked," these phrases are functionally identical and include both scenarios. The updated wording was introduced for clarity, particularly to ensure the ability works even if a card effect like Gum-Gum's 'Slide' moves the Weave creature into combat after it wasn't originally attacking.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No. The amount of energy removed from the target creature cannot exceed the energy currently on that creature. If you cast Syphon Vortex with X=6 and the target has only 2 energy, then only 2 energy is removed (and the creature is discarded), and 2 energy is added to your magi.

        You receive an amount of energy equal to the actual amount removed from the target creature, not necessarily X. The value of X determines the base amount moved, but this can be modified by effects like Scroll of Fire. If modifiers increase the damage, you gain that increased amount—up to what's available on the target. If they reduce it, you gain less.

        If you cast Syphon Vortex on a creature while you have a Scroll of Fire in play, what happens if you use Amanax's Pyromaniac Effect for the turn?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When using Amanax's Pyromaniac Effect, any damage dealt by your spells is doubled. If you cast Syphon Vortex with Scroll of Fire already in play and then activate Pyromaniac, the total damage (including both Scroll of Fire’s boost and any other modifiers) is doubled before energy is removed from the target. The amount of energy gained by Amanax equals the actual energy removed from the creature after all modifications—so if doubling results in more than the creature has, only what's available is taken.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        In a deck using Amanax as its last Magi that hoards cards, does casting Syphon Vortex for X+3 where X=11 (with Scroll of Fire active), discarding Blast Gloves to double damage (making it 24 total), result in Amanax gaining X=11 from the Syphon Vortex and 24 from Pyromaniac, totaling 35 energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No. The confusion arises from misapplying how Syphon Vortex and Pyromaniac interact. Syphon Vortex moves energy equal to the final damage dealt (after all modifiers), not separately applying X and then doubling. If you cast Syphon Vortex with X=11, Scroll of Fire increases it to 12, then discarding Blast Gloves doubles that to 24 damage. Amanax gains 24 energy from the actual amount removed from the target (up to what's available). He does not gain both X=11 and an additional 24—only the final moved amount (24) is added to him.

        There is no standard rule for this situation.

This is handled on a case-by-case basis. Some tournament rules address cheating and disqualification but do not cover honest mistakes.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The creature loses 4 Energy. 'Burrow: XXX loses no more than two energy from each opposing Spell, Power, or Attack.' Note that burrow very specifically does NOT protect from Effects. 'From an attack' refers to the attack mechanic of comparing Energy totals during attack resolution.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, the energy can be reduced as the energy removal is "locked in" once the spell is cast. For instance, removing all energy from a 11e Rock Hyren would remove 11e; but the Rock Hyren would reduce it to 9e. On the same lines, a response Paradwyn spell (Bloom) could add energy to the creature to prevent its death.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Sagawal may be discarded when one of your Creatures is reduced to zero energy by a Spell, "instead" of the Creature; however, the Creature will still be a zero energy Creature, and be discarded anyway. BUT, the source of this discard will then be the game rules, and not the card effect that reduced the Creature to zero energy. So, while it would generally be a waste to discard Sagawal when another Creature is reduced to zero energy and discarded, it will "erase" the effects of the Crushing Spell (or any card with a similar 'if this effect discards the chosen Creature from play') and keep your opponent from getting the secondary benefit.

        No. Whenever you apply both a reduction to the base amount and a cap, the reduction is applied before the cap.

        It can only choose one creature per use of the power, but if K'teeb stays in play long enough it could eventually Dream Cross and copy every legal target in play.

        For Woot's Effect Savagery, when you say energy removed in attacks cannot be prevented, can it still be reduced with something like Invulnerability?

      <div class="clarification-question">
        With Ahron + Chasm Jile: when Chasm Jile is attacked and you defeat it in order to play a new creature, even though it was Chasm Jile's effect, seeing as an opposing creature triggers the effect, can Ahron reduce the attacking creature to 1 energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Using the Dreamform Effect to discard the Chasm Jile does not count as defeating it. Defeat is specifically 'discarded from play as a result of having zero energy tokens,' or no energy and no Creatures in the case of a Defeated Magi.

        When Mowat attacks a creature that starts the attack with 3 energy and gains more energy through an effect or has an effect that can remove additional energy when attacked (example: Beeb), does Mowat lose energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Mowat's Skewer Effect activates when the attack is declared. Even if the defending creature gains energy after the attack is declared, Mowat will lose no energy in the attack if the defending creature started with 3 energy or less.

        Does Three-Leaf Clover prevent my Magi from being defeated when using Trug's Cataclysm power?

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Magi is clearly a card in play, and would normally be discarded and defeated by Trug's power. This makes activating Three-Leaf Clover a legal move, and it protects all of your cards including your Magi. Trug really dislikes three-leaf clovers...

        When Sorrowing Ogar uses Turn to change control of a creature, does the creature become an Underneath creature due to her Vile Memories effect?

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Turn does not play a creature; it merely changes control of a creature already in play and turns it Core. Sorrowing Ogar's Vile Memories only affects cards she plays.

        Harror, Nightstalker says she has no starting cards, yet she starts with Cataclysm—does this mean she can't use it or just can't search for it?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        It means that Harror, Nightstalker has no listed starting cards on the Magi, nothing more, nothing less. Cataclysm adds itself to Harror's starting card list, so she may search for it... but also cannot play it while Starfire is still in effect.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Effects such as Harror Nightstalker, Redream and Ytrha's Mantle do not interact with the keyword 'any' under Starting Cards (at least not until II prints a card named 'Any...'). Risha is immune to Nightstalker, but never did figure out how Ytrha got that darned mantle to work.

        Both Timber Effects compare the energy of the attacking creature with the energy of the defending creature. Only one Effect's condition is satisfied, and the attacking creature loses two energy.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        If you use a power on a card that discards the card, and then use Recall on it to bring it back, can you play it again and use its power right away, or do you have to wait until your next turn since the rule book says you can only use a power on a card once per turn? This is the same power on the same card, but it has been discarded and replayed.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        There is no Card Memory in MND. It is perfectly legal to use the power, discard, Recall, replay, and use the power again.

        Can I use powers on cards like "Warrior's Boots" and Magi "Whall's" power "Dream Twist" to summon Colossus, since I'm using a power to put energy on him, even though I'm basically just summoning him?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If you use Warpath from Warrior's Boots to bring Colossus into play, he gains his summoning energy 'as normal.' Warpath does not add or remove energy as a result of the Power, it simply changes the timing and allows you to 'immediately play a creature from your hand' using the normal Play Creatures rules. However, if you use Whall's Dream Twist (and indeed most other methods of bringing a Creature into play during the P/S/R step), he is not played 'as normal.' Instead, you are instructed to play him and then 'Put Energy onto the Creature' as part of the result of the Power. It is a minor but important distinction that prevents Dream Twist from giving energy to Colossus—if you target a Colossus with Dream Twist, he will enter play but receive no energy, and therefore be discarded.
