        In 2013 I manually copied the Yahoo Group rules digests Q/A to a text file my computer to make searching for cards easier. After the Yahoo Groups was shut down is was the only surviving backup of the data. The original text file is hosted <a href="https://jokerduel.github.io/magination/clarifications.html">here</a>.
        <br>
      The clarifications on this page was created by using an LLM to parse the original document and split it into a Question / Answer format. The LLM transformed and simplified the text so there may be hallucinations or other inaccuracies. When in doubt, check the original rules document.
      <br>
        There was a much smaller Magi-Nation Duel Rules Compendium that summarized some earlier rulings. For these the LLM created hypothetical questions to fit the dataset.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        If my deck has multiple cards that CAN be Starting Cards, can I draw all of those cards into my hand?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Each Magi's listed starting cards can only be retrieved once. For example, if your Magi has listed "Starting: Eebit, Weebo, Grow," you can only get one Eebit, one Weebo, and one Grow. Remember that non-Magi cards that have "Starting: <Magi Name>" on them are simply edits to the Magi's starting card list. When Krawg says "Starting: Ashgar," that just means that Ashgar now has Krawg added to his starting card list. So you can only get a single Krawg as a starting card for Ashgar; you can't retrieve all the Krawgs you're playing with.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        Can you use Shadow Cloak or Shell before bringing creatures into play, and will they protect those creatures from opposing spells and powers such as Corrupt?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, both Shadow Cloak and Shell can be used before playing creatures, and they will protect the next creature(s) played (assuming it's Orothe for Shell) from effects like Corrupt, which would discard the creature. While Corrupt is a Core Spell and not affected by Shadow Cloak, the protective effect of Shell still applies to the creature entering play.

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Since I can process my effects in the order that I want them to occur, if I have M'Rika out and Voda is my next Magi, can I interchange out and then process Voda's Deluge to add 4 to the biggest creature?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You must process Deluge since it will still be the same part of your turn, and Voda's Deluge is not optional.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Can I use Furok Guardian's effect more than once per turn? And if I discard a creature, bring it back with Furok Guardian, can I use that creature's power again since it returns as a new version of itself?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You can use Furok Guardian's effect as many times per turn as you have energy to pay. If you have 15 energy and discard three of your creatures one at a time, you could spend 5 energy each to return them all at the end of the turn. The Guardian would then be discarded due to having no energy left. Since the creature returns at the end of the turn, it cannot use its power immediately (as that step has already passed). However, if the creature had a power that could be used later in the turn or during future turns, yes—you could use it again because returning from discard creates a new version of the same creature. Note: Furok Guardian's Terra Rebirth triggers only on single discards, not multiple simultaneous discards (like those caused by Tidal Wave), so each discard must be separate.
      </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Can I play another copy of Agram's Plaything after morphing it into a creature with Puppet Strings, since the original now counts as a creature and there is no limit on the number of same-named creatures in play?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You cannot play another copy of Agram's Plaything because you can only play Relics if no card you control has the same name. Even though the original Agram's Plaything is now a creature due to being morphed, it still counts as having the same name, so playing another copy would violate the rule against duplicate named cards in play.
      </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Does choosing a region to target with Wildfire constitute a specific reference to core that would be affected by Ashio's Weave Twist?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Choosing a region doesn't cause that choice to appear in print on the card (where it would be affected by Weave Twist). Your assumption is correct.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If Abwyns Quill is used to make a card reference core, does that trigger Ashio's Weave Twist effect?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Ashio's Weave Twist checks on the reference constantly—if you changed it with Quill, the Weave Twist would immediately change it back.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Can Arderial use Abwyns Quill to make an anti-core card target core again, and what happens in that case?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, and as stated above, the Weave Twist would change it back immediately.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        When an opposing creature is discarded from play by one of your cards, do you draw a card with Evil Evu? Specifically, does using Syphon Stone to reduce a creature's energy to zero count as discarding it from play, and does defeating a creature in battle also trigger Evil Evu's effect?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, you draw a card when an opposing creature is discarded from play by one of your cards. This includes reducing a creature's energy to zero with Syphon Stone or defeating a creature in battle, as both actions result in the creature being removed from play.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        When using Hrada's Tainted Touch on a Magi, can that Magi still play relics from their original region?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Tainted Touch only allows the Magi to play Creatures and Spells; as such, the Magi is cut off from playing relics from their original region as they normally would. However, if a relic specifically allows the Shadow Magi of that region to play it, it may still be playable under Tainted Touch.
      </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If there is a 1 energy Wellisk in play and you play Koil, would Wellisk's Dream Barrier effect discard Koil and its energy first, or would Koil's Nightmare effect discard the one energy from Wellisk first, killing it?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The active player processes their effects first, so Koil would plink the Wellisk before the Wellisk could discard the Koil.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        With Rayje's Cloak, would it prevent Sorreah's Suppress?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, absolutely. That is one of the express purposes of Rayje's Cloak.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        What is the correct wording for the Recirculation rule in Magi-Nation Duel, and where is it officially published?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        During your Draw Step, if you are required to draw one or more cards and there are none left in your deck, immediately shuffle your discard pile into your deck and draw the remaining cards as needed. You may only recirculate your discard into your deck in this manner once per turn. If you need to draw from an empty deck a second time during your Draw Step, or if you need to do so for any reason outside your Draw Step, you simply do not get to draw the needed cards. There is no penalty for not being able to draw in these situations, nor do any Effects that normally are activated upon drawing a card come into play.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        What happens when you cast Vortex of Knowledge or multiple Vortices on Step 2 with only one card left? Do you draw just that one card?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, you draw only the one card remaining in your deck.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        What about casting Spectral Shield on Step 2 with only one card left?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You still gain a shield counter as normal, regardless of how many cards are left in your deck.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        What does Lascinth's 'Reflex' ability do, and why is it useful?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Lascinth's Reflexes effect allows it to remove its opponent's energy before the opponent can remove its energy, normally happening simultaneously. If this early removal causes the opponent to lose all their energy, the creature dies immediately, preventing them from dealing damage in return.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        What happens when you 'lockdown' Lockdown? Do existing effects from the previous Lockdown go away, and how can the second Lockdown function?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Previous one-shot effects are not retroactively removed—damage already dealt remains. However, ongoing effects (such as preventing spell plays or reducing combat damage) are suppressed and cannot be used while the Lockdown is active. If you Lockdown Lockdown, all Lockdowns in play—including your own—are silenced, meaning you cannot access your Belt to repeat the action until the initial Lockdown ends.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If Rock Slide is used and the biggest creature in play cannot be disregarded from play, does it automatically work on the next biggest creature?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        It comes down to the wording on the card. If the creature says "cannot be discarded from play..." then the Rock Slide cannot be played at all. If the creature says "is not affected by Spells, etc. that specifically discard..." then the Rock Slide can be played but has no effect. In any case it doesn't revert to the second largest in play.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If my opponent drops a Belt and names Burrow, and I steal it with a Cube, is Burrow still locked down?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes. Gaining control of a card that did something does not mean that whatever it did previously is undone.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Do cards lose memory if they switch sides of the table?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Generally speaking, no. If there are exceptions, it will mention it on the card.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If I bring into play Warriors Boots during my first PRS step and instantly use them to bring out a Junjertrug, can I then play another Warriors Boots in the same PRS step to bring out another creature?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes. Junjertrug must attack each turn if able, but that does not mean that as soon as you play him, you must immediately switch to your Attack Step.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If I have a card in play that allows me to pay one less Energy to play a Creature (ex: Swamp Hyren's Effect), when my Creature hits the table, does it get its Starting Energy or the amount of energy I spent to play it (in this case, one less energy)?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Paying energy to bring out a creature is not the same as sliding energy counters from your Magi to the creature. The energy is actually and truly lost when you use it to play a creature, and then when the creature enters play, it comes in with whatever its Starting Energy is listed as. So if you want to bring in a 5-energy creature, you pay 5e from your Magi, and then it comes in with 5e. If you have a card that allows you a discount on that cost — say, Shadow Tony Jones — then you would pay 4e, but the creature would still come in with energy equal to its starting energy — i.e., 5e.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        How does Jungle Hyren's ability work when playing a 5e creature? If I twist it to 7e, do I pay 7 energy and it starts with 7 energy? Does this also apply if I twist it down to 3e?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You've got it correct. Jungle Hyren's ability lets you alter the Starting Energy of the creature you play, ranging from 3 to 7. If you choose to play it as a 7e creature, you pay its Starting Energy cost (7 energy), and it enters play with 7 energy. Similarly, if you twist it down to 3e, you pay 3 energy and it starts with 3 energy. The changed Starting Energy only lasts until the end of the turn, but this does not affect the current amount of energy on the creature while in play.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        When forced to discard a card by Protect, my opponent discards Abraxin's Crown. Can I use Deep Wellisk's Sunken Treasure effect to prevent the Crown from knocking out my hand and energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No. Sunken Treasure only applies when a card is played, not when it is discarded. Since Abraxin's Crown was discarded rather than played, its effect resolves normally and cannot be stopped by Sunken Treasure.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        What happens when there are two Corrupts in play? When the first creature is played, does the second Corrupt activate for the same creature, or do they each trigger separately when different creatures are played?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When a creature is played, both Corrupts trigger simultaneously. They then resolve in player order, meaning the creature becomes Core and changes control to each player in turn, one after another. The final controller of the creature will be the last player in player order who resolves their Corrupt effect. As a result, one creature can end up affected by multiple Corrupts if they are all resolved before it leaves play.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Spells, Powers, and Effects do not reduce energy loss. What does that specifically apply to? I thought that it refers to energy loss on the Magi; thinking that Collar of Dispair for instance wouldn't affect the magi if the sword is used. Could someone clarify this for me? Examples are helpful.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Pretty much anything that would reduce energy loss. For example, the Invulnerability Effect ("X loses one less energy from attacks.") is a good example with regards to Creatures. Collar doesn't cause an energy loss, it simply reduces a number on the card (which is then used during the game to determine how much energy to add to the Magi).

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        After using Giant Parathin's Interchange power, if Vorga is defeated and Gar is the next undefeated Magi in my pile, how do I get to Gar?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When your current Magi is defeated and you go to get your next one, you reveal the next undefeated Magi in your stack. It doesn't matter if there is a Defeated one already in the way.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        When Dave plays an Eebit while having a Robe of Vines on the table and Eebit Brother has a Naroom Shadow Geyser in play, does the geyser or the robe effect resolve first?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When two or more effects are triggered at the same time, they are resolved in player order. The active player (Dave) resolves all his effects first, so he adds one energy from the Robe of Vines. Then, when the Eebit Brother resolves his effects, the Naroom Shadow Geyser causes the Eebit to lose two energy. The Eebit survives with just one energy remaining.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If a card allows you to play Brushfire from your discard pile once per turn, can you play multiple copies of Brushfire each turn if you have more than one in your discard pile?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, the ability says "once per turn" which limits you to playing only one Brushfire from your discard pile per turn, regardless of how many are in your discard pile.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Can I use multiple Brushfires in one turn if they are in my discard pile?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, you can only use one Brushfire per turn, even if multiple Brushfires are in your discard pile. Each Brushfire's effect says 'once per turn,' so the first time you play a Brushfire from your discard each turn is the only time you may do so.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        If you play a Giant Parathin and then activate its power, does the next Magi get to play Creatures or is it stuck in the second Powers phase?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Even though you swap Magi, the order of your turn is not changed. If you are in the 2nd PSR step when you begin Interchange, you are still in the 2nd PSR step when it is finished.
      </div>

      <div class="clarification-question">
        Can a Deep Hyren discard itself in order to use its Power (Hurricane) if it has its Starting Energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If the Deep Hyren is at 7 energy, then after using Hurricane it will still be around with 1 energy and can be discarded. However, if it is at 6 energy, it will be immediately discarded when paying the energy cost for its Power.
      </div>

      <div class="clarification-question">
        If I play Solar Flare twice on my turn, would all my surviving Arderial creatures that attacked and defeated an opposing creature get 8 energy instead of only 4 energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes. Quite a power play if you can get the situation to come up right.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        Does Burrowed count if used on Crystal Parmalag?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Burrow does not work to reduce the energy loss of Crystal Parmalag. While Burrow prevents more than two energy from being lost per turn, Crystal Parmalag's ability specifically prevents any spells, powers, or effects from preventing it from losing energy, which overrides Burrow's effect.

        If you use a Belt on a card with an ongoing effect like Shadow Cloak, does the effect get canceled?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No. The Belt prevents future uses of whatever you Lockdown. Anything already activated does not get 'turned off.'

        Can I use Eyes of Arderial to name Gilded Cage and prevent its discard effect?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, you cannot use Eyes of Arderial to prevent Gilded Cage's discard effect because the effect is not part of the spell being played—it is an alternative text or activated effect that triggers when the ability resolves, not during casting. Eyes of Arderial only prevents spells from being cast, so it does not apply to effects like Gilded Cage's.

        When you run out of cards in your library, when exactly do you shuffle your discard pile and make it your library? Can your discard pile be "recycled" more than once a turn?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Your discard pile can only be shuffled into your deck during your Draw Step, when you would draw a card and cannot because your deck is empty. And this recirculation can only happen once per Draw Step.

Add one energy to each Core and Bograth Creature and Magi in play.'). By my literal interpretation, the spell does not remove energy from my creatures/magi or Arderial's creatures/magi because it would remove energy from my magi (assuming I had energy on my Magi), since the text says 'discards no energy'. Is this a correct interpretation? The same applies if a Deep Hyren uses Hurricane, a Core Grag detonates, etc.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        OFFICIAL CLARIFICATION. Treat Uwamar Beads as if it says '...discards no energy from your Magi.' This is how Uwamar Beads is meant to operate (yes that infamous designer intent rears its ugly head again).

        Has there been any reversal of, or thoughts of reversing, the ruling about defensive effects triggering an additional time when an attack is redirected (e.g., Bo'Ahsa)?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, there has been no reversal or change to the ruling. When an attack is redirected, defensive effects can trigger again, as seen with Bo'Ahsa redirecting to Speag, allowing Speag's ability to activate twice and benefiting from Zassyfer's effect both times. This is part of Weave's strength—being attacked triggers powerful interactions.

        How does Kesia work with Mantle of Shadow?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Mantle of Shadow allows any magi to play Core spells, but Kesia's ability specifically restricts her from playing non-Weave spells. Since Kesia's restriction is self-referential and more specific than Mantle of Shadow's general allowance, Kesia cannot play non-Core spells.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="clarification-entry">
      <div class="clarification-question">
        Is the Specificity argument valid for resolving conflicts between card effects like Mantle and Kesia's restriction?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Specificity argument is problematic and overly complex. While both Cloak and Kesia impose restrictions on who can play what, Mantle creates a specific exception allowing Kesia to play Core region spells despite her general restriction against non-Weave regions. Stealth is generally available to Weave magi but specifically restricted for Kesia, making it less specific than the Mantle's targeted exception. The intent behind Mantle is explicitly to override Kesia’s limitation, suggesting that a more straightforward resolution—such as treating Mantle as an overriding effect rather than relying on specificity—is preferable. Given the ongoing confusion and pain caused by this argument, especially in cases like Hrada Lock, it is recommended to abandon the Specificity vs. General framework entirely and seek alternative rule mechanisms.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Xamf's effect does not trigger. Xamf's ability checks whether your smallest creature is larger than your opponent's largest creature. If you have no creatures in play, you do not have a smallest creature, so the condition cannot be evaluated as true. Even though you technically 'have more creatures' than your opponent (who has none), the effect specifically requires that you have at least one creature to compare sizes. Therefore, with no creatures, the condition fails and the ability does not trigger.

        When using Koll's Dream Twist ability to bring in a creature, does the player need to pay the creature's starting energy cost?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You do not need to pay the energy cost of bringing in the new creature via Koll; it is already 'subsumed' in the process of paying for the Power and discarding of another creature in the first place. Generally speaking, the default assumption for not-specified cards like this is that if an energy cost is not specified when playing a card in some alternate fashion, then there is no energy cost.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Colossus and Crystal Parmalag remain in play because they are protected against specific creature discards. Deep Wellisk also remains in play because it resists being specifically discarded from play, though it does not have the Anti-Magic effect as a named ability.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The term "restore" is considered energy addition if the total energy change is higher than the original amount of energy on the card, and energy removal if going down. Effects which are triggered upon adding or losing energy would be activated, as appropriate. If a creature is at the same energy level it was before the Restore, then it is considered neither addition nor subtraction, and no effects activate as a result.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If you Interchange, then by definition you were not able to "choose a number" at the beginning of that turn (since Elios wasn't out at the time). Thus, when the time comes to draw cards, you just draw your normal two cards. If you play Flood of Energy, you energize at whatever your Magi's energize rate is at the time. So, yes, if you Interchange into Elios, his Energize Rate for the remainder of the turn is still 8, since you didn't adjust it at the beginning of the turn.

        How does Kybar's Echo interact with discarding effects?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Kybar's Echo is a replacement effect: when one of your Kybar's Teeth creatures would be discarded, it is instead returned to your hand and never enters the discard pile. This means it does not count as being 'discarded' for triggering other card effects, though it can still trigger return-to-hand effects like Motash's Staff.

        Yes, despite the MRP (Master Rulebook Principle) for Tranquility, Resonate can still be played in discard energy mode, even though it won't actually discard energy.

        The power still happens normally; if the power affects the now-discarded creature (such as a Xyx Minor trying to use Gathering Clouds on itself with only two energy), then the power will still happen, it just will not be able to show any result. If that same Xyx Minor spent all of its energy to use Gathering Clouds on a different Xyx, then the surviving Xyx would receive the four energy, regardless of the creature using the power being discarded.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">

        Can Wiep use his Power - Power Drain:(2) Choose any Power on an opposing creature. Move energy equal to the cost of the chosen Power from that creature to Wiep, on my Gorath, naming the cost of (x) as 8?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Enslavement has no cost associated with it; when you use it, you choose an energy total and discard that much from Gorath, then gain control of a Creature with energy less than what you just discarded. Power Drain would move nothing from Gorath. Furthermore, any X is treated as zero except in the context of playing the card or using the ability with the X cost.

        If the Tomes are Cleansed, can Shadow Naroom play them despite the text 'only Naroom and Shadow Naroom may play Tomes'?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Shadow Naroom can still play the Tomes even if they are Cleansed, because the reminder text grants the ability to play the card specifically to Naroom and Shadow Naroom Magi. This is consistent with how abilities work on other cards like Crushing Roots, which also specifies 'only Naroom Magi and Naroom Shadow Magi may play' it, allowing Shadow Naroom to play it even when Cleansed. Similarly, if a Core or Bograth card were Cleansed to Underneath, only Core and Bograth Magi could play it—Underneath Magi would not be able to play the Cleansed card due to the specific restriction.

        Quido Swarm may be played with no creatures on the table; it will immediately discard itself for having no energy.

        Do the additional cards drawn to reach a hand size of five at the beginning of the game count as 'drawing' cards for the purposes of in-game effects?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The cards that a player draws to get a hand of five at the beginning of their first turn do not count as drawing cards for the purposes of in-game effects. For instance, if a player started with Marella as their first Magi, they would still receive any one Weave Creature and then draw four cards, as well as drawing one card at the end of her turn. Similarly, if there were some way to give a player who has not started their turn a Creature, and you had a Darkbreed's Minion in play, their Creature would not lose energy from Smolder. In your example, the Mydra Swarm would only stop them from drawing cards with card effects and the two cards at the end of their first turn.

        Can a spell be played for zero mana cost to trigger effects that depend on discarding energy, even if no actual energy is discarded?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        It is legal to play a card with an X cost where X equals 0, whether by choice or due to game effects. However, discarding zero energy does not count as an actual energy discard for triggering effects that require an amount of energy to be discarded. Since 'zero' means 'lacking an amount,' it does not satisfy conditions requiring a non-zero energy discard. This is why playing a spell like Quido Swarm for zero mana to remove Corrupt is allowed, but using such a play to trigger effects based on discarding energy (e.g., Charm) is not valid.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If a card discards energy, and there are other effects in play that prevent any form of energy discard prevention, then the energy discard will happen even if the target creature could normally not be affected by anything; however, other effects of the card will still be prevented. For example, if a Koil protected by Shadow Cloak takes damage from Firefly Swarm while Rayje's Sword is in play, the Koil loses two energy but remains protected from the secondary effect of Firefly Swarm and can still attack on your next turn.

        Resilience prevents any excess energy discard that would reduce Olabra's creatures below one energy. If the energy removal cannot be prevented, Resilience has no effect.

        Pyromancy only increases the amount of energy discarded; Syphon Vortex's 'move' is shorthand for 'discard X energy from an opposing Creature and add X energy to your Magi'.

        Bog Stench and Imaginary Friends do not create 'pseudo-Creatures'; they increase the effects of cards that count your Bograth Creatures or just your Creatures in play by letting you 'count as' having that many additional Bograth Creatures in play.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When the Yajo is attacked, its Weave ability triggers and may transfer one energy to or from another Weave Creature in play. However, when the Yajo is swapped with the Chasm Jile, the Chasm Jile does not have Weave, so no energy can be transferred. That said, if the new defender has Weave, then Weave would trigger on that creature as well. Additionally, any other effects triggered by a creature being attacked (such as Speag) will trigger both times—once for the original attack and once when the new target is attacked.

        Yes, Flame Trulb counts itself; its effect does not trigger until it is actually in play, and Familiarity does not specify 'other' Bograth and Cald creatures in play.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, the effects stack because they are described as direct additions or subtractions to the actual energize rate. Grand Epik's Mind Feast reduces your magi's energize by two, and Akkar's Rolling Thunder increases it by two when your opponent has more creatures out than you. If both effects apply simultaneously, they can increase or decrease the energize rate by up to six or more points depending on how many copies are in play. However, if multiple cards grant 'ENERGIZE:1', the result is still only ENERGIZE:1 unless the card already had a higher energize rate, as cards always use their highest energize rate.

        If I have a Hurricane Orish in play with Voice of the Storm, and I play another Hurricane Orish, does it come in for two less energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Hurricane Orish in play, being both Orothe and Arderial, will decrease the cost of your Arderial and your Orothe Creatures played. When you play another Hurricane Orish, because it is an Orothe Creature, it will cost one less, and because it is an Arderial Creature, it will cost an additional one less, therefore, the end result is that it costs two less energy to play.

        If I have a Grim Goblet in play and use Rayje's Belt lockdown to cancel the backlash effect to prevent my hand from discarding, and then Beam of Light is used to discard both relics at the same time, do I have to discard my hand because the lockdown power loses its effect or not? And what about if I have an Abranix Crown in my hand—will it take effect or not?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Lockdown will end when the Belt leaves play; similarly, any continuous effects of a Power do not end until the card(s) targeted by Beam of Light are successfully discarded from play. The Grim Goblet has also already been discarded, and you will not suffer the Backlash. If you do suffer from Backlash and are forced to discard an Abraxin's Crown, its discard effect will not trigger; it must be discarded from your hand by an opposing card to do so, even if an opposing card forced you to discard the Goblet and triggered Backlash.

        Your 15 energy Wudge would only remove one energy if an Elder Yark were present because Rayje's Sword does not go into effect; any card that causes a creature to remove its starting energy instead of its current energy during an attack is not considered to be preventing energy loss.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Each time you play a new Pyder, you transfer all but one energy your Magi currently has to it. Whenever you play a Creature, each Pyder's Summoning will trigger. As the active player, you choose the order they resolve in. You must choose a Pyder that has enough energy to play the Creature to resolve first, or you cannot play the Creature. The rest of your Pyder's Summonings will resolve, and you will discard energy from them equal to how much energy is necessary to pay the cost of the Creature played, which is now zero. When your Magi energizes, all of your Pyders' Leaderships will trigger. You choose which resolves first, and that Pyder receives all of the extra energy beyond one of the Magi. The rest of your Pyders will receive zero energy, since your Magi does not have any amount over one any longer.

        No; the text on cards happens in the order that the text is written, unless the card itself states an exception.

        When Sheath says it prevents a creature from using an effect, does it shut off effects like "Burrow"? Or does this simply mean one-time use effects?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Sheath prevents the Creature it is printed on from using any Effects that are part of its own abilities. If a Creature such as Pylofuf is Sheathed, then it loses the ability to use Burrow, and its burrow status is removed since it is granted by an Effect on the Creature. However, if a Creature like Korrit has had a nine-turn Burrow Spell cast on it, Sheathing it does not remove its burrowed status because the Burrow effect comes from a separate spell, not from the Creature's own Effects. Similarly, if a Tunnel Hyren is Sheathed, its Burrow ability stops, but an Underneath Creature that becomes Sheathed while a Tunnel Hyren is in play will still retain its burrowed benefit as long as the Hyren remains in play and can use its Effect.

        No, Rayje was not intended to function that way. He can only gain one copy of any Power or Effect, regardless of how many copies of himself are in play.

        If I have a Pylofuf in play with 7 energy, and it is attacked by an opposing Shielded Parmalag with 2 energy on it with a 4 energy Giant Korrit joining in the attack, what amount of energy is removed from the Pylofuf? Does the Pack Hunt Effect remove extra damage from the Pylofuf, or does the Effect Enable an Attack which does not allow for more than 2 energy to be removed this turn?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Pylofuf takes 4 energy damage. The Pack Hunt effect allows multiple attackers to attack together, but it doesn't limit total damage taken—only that each attacker can only deal up to 2 energy of damage per turn unless otherwise specified. Since the Giant Korrit has 4 energy and is attacking, it deals its full 4 energy in damage. The Shielded Parmalag contributes 2 energy, but the Pylofuf’s ability does not reduce damage from multiple attackers. Therefore, a total of 6 energy is dealt (2 from the Parmalag + 4 from the Giant Korrit), and since Pylofuf has 7 energy, it loses 6 energy. The Pack Hunt effect enables the combined attack but does not restrict the total damage or reduce extra damage beyond what’s specified.

        My opponent has Emlob as his Magi with one energy and no creatures in play. He casts Trulb Horde, bringing his Magi to 0 energy, but as the spell resolves, a 1 Energy creature is coming into play. Is Emlob defeated before the creature comes into play since he has no energy and no creatures, or is the Magi not checked for defeat until after any given spell resolves?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Emlob is not defeated before the creature comes into play. The Magi is only checked for defeat after a spell fully resolves. Since Trulb Horde's effect causes a 1 Energy creature to enter play as part of resolving, Emlob remains in play because the creature enters before any check for defeat occurs.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Magi does not get defeated during the resolution of the spell. The condition for defeat occurs only when the spell finishes resolving and there are no creatures in play. Since a creature is brought into play after the spell resolves, the Magi remains in play. Emlob would also be able to use this effect while the spell is resolving because he is considered to have 3 extra Bograth creatures at that time, satisfying any relevant conditions.

        Overwriting Wind Spawn does not simply allow Kalius to play Core Creatures; it would have to say "play a Core Creature ignoring regional restrictions" if that were the case.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        As with any other 'any' starting card specification, you must search the discard pile first for any cards that fit the 'any' specification.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No. Due to changes made during playtesting, Syphon Vortex no longer allows cards to add energy to Tryn. If she uses Syphon Vortex, she spends X + 4 energy and gains nothing back; her Energy Substitution effect converts the discarded energy into gained energy, but this does not apply in a way that enables infinite or excessive energy gain. The ability to channel all energy into a substituted Syphon Vortex and then use Updraft to create an extreme energy advantage was one of the reasons this change was implemented.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        From now on, cards will explicitly state whether you pay the costs when they enter play through alternate means. The Tomes were an oversight due to insufficient playtesting revisions; their wording did not align with current templating standards.

        If a creature has multiple regions, such as Weave/Naroom, and a spell affects all non-Weave creatures, does the creature's Weave region protect it, or is it affected because of its Naroom region?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        A creature with multiple regions is considered to be a creature of every region listed. Therefore, if a card affects all non-Weave creatures, a Weave/Naroom creature is unaffected because it is a Weave creature—having one region that matches Weave means it does not qualify as 'non-Weave.' The term 'non-Weave' refers to creatures that lack the Weave region entirely.

        If a Zannah's creature is stalked and then attacked, does the damage from stalking get negated by burrowing or other effects, and how does the source of the damage affect this?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When Zannah's Charm has not been activated previously and one of her stalked creatures is attacked, the one energy lost to stalking is prevented by Charm. The damage from stalking comes from a rule (not a spell, power, or effect), so it bypasses effects like burrowing. However, since the source of the damage is the attacking creature, any abilities that negate damage based on source will apply—meaning if the attacker has an ability that negates damage from its own attacks, it could prevent this damage.

        Does the word "Immediately" in Wellisk's effect mean it resolves before any other effects, or does it work like standard triggered effects?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The word "immediately" means you must choose to use Dream Barrier as soon as possible, before the opponent can perform any other non-triggered actions on their turn, but after the Creature is successfully played; any other Effects triggered simultaneously do 'stack' alongside it and resolve normally. Wellisk uses the wording 'immediately after' instead of 'as another Creature is played' so that the Creature played will get an opportunity to enter play and trigger any related Effects, as well as trigger similar Effects for leaving play. For example, if the opponent has a Wudge in play and you have a Wellisk, and they spend five energy to play a Chaos Plith, when Chaos Plith enters play, both Strengthen and Dream Barrier are triggered; Strengthen resolves first because the opponent is the active player, giving Wudge +1 energy, and then you choose whether or not to discard the Wellisk and use the rest of Dream Barrier's effect to discard the Chaos Plith from play. If the opponent had a Corrupted Sphor taken from you, the Chaos Plith being discarded by Dream Barrier would also trigger Scavenge. The word 'immediately' serves no functional purpose other than to emphasize that you must decide whether or not to use the rest of Dream Barrier then, before anything else aside from a simultaneously triggered Effect can be played/used.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Ullig will not gain 4 energy in this case because the creature did not leave play through a discard mechanic. She would be instantly defeated if she has no energy and no Dewstone in play, as returning a creature to hand does not trigger Fearless. The ability only activates when a creature is discarded from play by a discard effect or reduced to zero energy and removed from play.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, the Power still works normally. If the Power affects the creature after it has been discarded due to depleted energy (such as Xyx Minor using Gathering Clouds on itself with only two energy), the effect still occurs, though it cannot produce any visible result. For example, if a Xyx Minor spends all its energy to use Gathering Clouds on another Xyx, the surviving Xyx will receive four energy regardless of the original creature being discarded.

        With Siphon Vortex, do you gain the energy that is removed from the target Creature, or does it depend on damage dealt?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Siphon Vortex's most recent wording states 'move X energy from an opposing Creature to your Magi'. This is a move/transfer effect where both discarding the energy and gaining it are dependent on each other. If the energy loss is prevented (e.g., by Fird Stone), then no energy is gained. Similarly, if the amount of discarded energy changes due to effects like Scroll of Fire, the same amount is added to your Magi.

        Yes, as long as all conditions are met, you may activate any number of applicable cards. When an opponent plays a Spell or Power, you can activate not only one copy of Bahza's Pendant but also play every Bloom in hand that qualifies. This creates a chain of reactions—similarly, playing a Creature triggers each Reef Hyren's Rebuke in play, allowing multiple uses as long as the triggering conditions are satisfied.

        When does Stalking damage occur relative to other effects like Weave?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Both Stalking and Weave are triggered by a creature being attacked. The active player’s effects resolve first. Therefore, if you attack during your turn, Weave resolves before Stalking, allowing the creature to transfer energy before losing it. However, if you attack an opponent's creature on their turn, they are the active player, so their Weave effect would resolve first (if applicable), followed by the Stalking damage.

      <div class="clarification-answer">

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You may use Dreamwarp to increase or decrease the starting energy value of the N'Kala creatures until the end of the turn, but they will still only have one energy because Waking Dreams specifically states that the creatures played by it have one energy instead of their normal starting energy. Additionally, Waking Dreams requires you to choose three different creatures, so you cannot select two N'Kalas.

      <div class="clarification-answer">

        Can someone explain the second regions on Nightmare's Dawn cards?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When a card has a second region, it functions exactly the same as a single region card of both different regions within the context of the rules. For a Creature, this means Magi of either region may play the Creature without paying regional penalties. For a Relic, this means a Magi of either region can play it. For Magi, it means they can play cards of either of their regions without penalty or restriction. Additionally, when a card effect refers to a card type of either region on a multi-region card matching the named card type, then it affects that card normally. For instance, a Cald/Weave Creature cannot be affected by a Firefly Swarm, as Firefly Swarm cannot affect Cald Creatures. Conversely, an Arderial/Naroom Creature could be affected by Call of the Wild on Essence of Naroom since it is a Naroom Creature. One last note regarding Braggle and multi-region Creatures; if either of the two regions on a Creature involved in combat with the Braggle match Braggle's region, then its Effect will prevent combat damage as normal.

        If I have a corrupted Pylofuf and I place Agram's Armor on it, does it lose no energy in attacks? Because Pylofuf says it may only lose two energy in attacks and spells per turn, and Agram's Armor says the chosen creature loses 2 less. So if it loses 2 and then 2 less, does that mean it loses no energy?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Effects that alter the amount of energy being lost are always applied before those that limit the energy loss. The same goes for things that alter card costs and those that halve or limit the costs of the cards. Therefore, the amount of energy assigned to be removed in the attack by the opposing creature will be reduced by two because of the Armor, then the amount left will be reduced to a maximum of two by Burrow.

        Does Gwaeg return to your hand if a spell, power, or effect discards it? What if I discard it to use the Moob ring? Some people in my area say the text on Gwaeg means that the Creature only returns to your hand when it is attacked.
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        When a card refers to a Creature having to be 'defeated while defending', then it means the Creature must be attacked and reduced to zero energy at any time during the attack. If a one-energy Gwaeg were attacked by a Lahalou with three energy, then when both Creatures remove energy from each other normally, the Gwaeg would be defeated while defending, and return to its owner's hand. If the same example happened and the Gwaeg was stalked, making it lose its one energy before energy is normally discarded, it would be defeated while defending (because the definition of defeat is simply to be reduced to zero energy), and would return to its owner's hand. However, if the Gwaeg was attacked and you chose to discard it to fulfill another card effect—such as a card that said 'Effect - You're Mean: When one of your Bograth Creatures is attacked, you may discard it from play before energy is removed to make the attacking player feel bad'—then it would not be 'defeated while defending', because it was discarded directly from play and was not reduced to zero energy, and it would stay in the discard pile.

        Is moving Energy the same as saying 'Discard Energy from A and Add Energy to B'? If so, does Move trigger Amanax's power?

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If Amanax were to use Syphon Vortex on a Creature with six energy, spending ten energy for the X portion of the Vortex's cost, he would gain twelve energy, because he can only move six from the Creature to himself, and then he would only gain the six energy discarded by the Spell with his Effect.

        Syphon Vortex vs. Rock Hyren: Rock Hyren has 11e and his Effect Invulnerability: Lose 2 less Energy from Spells. Can SV be cast for 17e, X being 13 to kill the Rock Hyren, or is X limited to the amount of energy on the Creature? And how much energy does the Magi get back, the 11 or 13e?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You can make X as high as you can afford, and the Syphon Vortex will attempt to discard X energy, adding back an amount to your Magi equal to what was actually discarded. Invulnerability will stop the first two 'points' of the Vortex, then the excess will get through. If it is enough to discard the Hyren, then it will do so, and the Magi will receive an amount of energy equal to how much was actually discarded. In the example given, the Hyren would be discarded, and the Magi would regain eleven energy.

        Kyg'n is defeated immediately when a Creature is declared to attack him, before any other effects are triggered.

      </div>

        Being 'stalked' is a condition generated by a game mechanic; it does not discard energy as a Spell, Power, or Effect, but by the Creature attacking the stalked Creature.

        When you play an Alpine Xamf, does it gain the benefit of its own effect and does it gain 2 energy for being both a Kybar's Teeth and a Naroom creature?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Whenever you play a card, the 'whenever you play' effect triggers at the moment the card leaves your hand and is scheduled to enter the playing field. By that time, the Alpine Xamf has already been played, so its own effect does not activate for itself. However, once it successfully enters play, all effects on the card become active, including 'when this creature enters play' effects. Since Flame Trulb must be in play before its effect triggers and counts itself as a creature, the Alpine Xamf cannot gain energy from itself at entry—but if Flame Trulb is already in play, it can count the Xamf as a creature for triggering effects.

        When you take control of a Corathan using Turn, River Abiquist, Crushing Darkness, or similar means, does its effect trigger so you can search your own discard pile for a Core or Orothe card and place it in your hand?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, the effect does not trigger when you take control of Corathan. You gain control of the creature immediately after the theft resolves, but the effect is tied to the original controller’s action. Since the card wasn’t stolen by the player who now controls it during their turn (or under conditions that would allow triggering), the effect doesn't activate for them. This is consistent with how Morag using Theft on a Karak Band would gain no energy—control transfer does not trigger effects based on theft unless explicitly tied to the controller’s actions.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, you do not draw 2 cards or gain 2 energy when taking control of a Karak Necklace or Band. The effect triggers only if the card is stolen by the player who gains control during their turn and under conditions that satisfy the theft bonus. Since gaining control through means like Hubdra's Cube or Crushing Surf does not count as an act of 'theft' for triggering such effects, the benefit does not apply to you—similar to how Morag would gain no energy from stealing a Karak Band with Theft.

        No; though you are playing a card someone else owns, it is entering play under your control.

        If Tryn Flamesaver follows the Dark Twins, she becomes a Naroom Shadow Magi but loses her Cald status. The Dark Twins specifically cause the Magi to become only a Naroom Shadow Magi, so the limitations of being a Shadow Magi take precedence and she cannot play non-core cards.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Climbing Staff cannot stop any part of the Vaporize spell. Vaporize affects both the Magi and their Relics, not just the Magi, so it does not qualify as a spell that solely affects a Magi or a player's hand. Therefore, Climbing Staff has no effect on Vaporize.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Because Climbing Staff gives the broad range of "whenever", if an active continuous Effect is affecting only your Magi, then as long as the Effect is active there is no moment in time that you cannot discard a Climbing Staff from your hand or from play, with the exception of when it is being discarded by something else. In the situation you mentioned, the very last moment you could discard it would be when the Spell is played, but before it resolves. Once it starts resolving, the hands are revealed and then the Relics (or Spells) are discarded without a "pause" to throw the Staff away and shut down Sorreah.

        Can a Magi grab an alternate version of a card listed in their starting cards?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        An Alternate of a card is considered that card for the purposes of game rules. You can only have three copies of a card in your deck, so you cannot include both regular and alternate versions if they exceed this limit. For example, you could not play three Furoks and three Dark Furoks. A Magi who starts with an alternate version (like Evil Evu starting with Dark Furok) can still start with the original card (e.g., a normal Furok). Similarly, since cards listed under 'STARTING: xxxx Magi' are treated as if they were printed on that Magi, any alternate version of such a card is also available as a starting card. For example, Krawg has 'STARTING: Ashgar', and because 'Good Ol' Ashgar' is an alternate version of Ashgar, either Magi can start with Krawg or its alternate version if one exists. Likewise, if 'Any Cald Magi' were added to Ash Hyren's starting cards, any Cald Magi could begin with either Ash Hyren or Darkbreed's Minion.

        If I play Stealth on one of my creatures and attack an opposing creature, but my opponent has Rayje's Sword out, does Stealth still work?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Stealth still works because it does not reduce energy loss; instead, it allows your creature to remove energy from the opposing creature before they can remove energy from your creature. Although the amount of energy removed is lower, no energy loss reduction occurs within the rules context.

        Does Rayje's Sword's Piercing ability prevent effects that reduce energy loss, such as those granted by spells or powers?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, Rayje's Sword's Piercing ability prevents any Spell, Power, or Effect—named or not—from reducing energy loss. If a Spell, Power, or Effect indirectly causes reduced energy loss (such as granting a burrowed status that limits energy loss), Piercing allows the full energy loss to occur unaltered. However, if the reduction in energy loss comes from a game mechanic inherent to a card's text (like being buried by a card effect not explicitly tied to a Spell or Power), then Piercing does not apply.

        How does Piercing interact with effects that prevent damage or other results from Spells, Powers, or Effects?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Piercing allows a Spell, Power, or Effect to discard energy normally even if it would otherwise be prevented by an effect like Protection, Resistance, or another similar ability. However, only the energy discarding portion is allowed; any other effects of the Spell, Power, or Effect are still prevented by the original immunity.

        Does Piercing prevent a replacement effect that reduces the amount of energy discarded during an attack?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Piercing does not affect replacement effects that set the amount of energy to be discarded to a fixed value less than what the creature would normally discard. Such effects are not considered energy loss prevention, so Piercing cannot stop them. For example, Regal Presence on Elder Yark replaces the energy discarded during an attack with either the attacker's starting or current energy, whichever is lower. This is a replacement effect, not damage reduction, so Piercing does not prevent it.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Piercing does not circumvent restrictions that prevent using Spells, Powers, or Effects that discard energy. If a card cannot be used at all due to such a restriction, like being Lockdown by Rayje's Belt, then Piercing has no effect and the energy cannot be discarded as intended.

        How does Piercing interact with effects that reduce energy loss, such as a creature's ability to reduce damage or energy cost?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Piercing does not prevent a player from using a Spell, Power, or Effect that reduces energy loss; instead, it negates the effect of that reduction. For example, if a creature like Pylofuf uses its Burrow ability to reduce energy loss during an attack, and the attacking player has Rayje's Sword in play with Piercing, then Burrow’s energy loss reduction will have no effect—though the ability can still be used. This is because Piercing stops the energy loss reduction portion of the effect, not the use of the ability itself.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The ability for you to be protected from not being able to use Powers, Effects, etc., is caused by an Effect on the Cloak.

      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        If you have let your opponent get to the point where they are choosing what the Beam of Light is affecting, then it is too late to use Time Lapse. Time Lapse states 'whenever an opponent plays a card you may discard Phrup from play.' This means when they actually play it but before any choices are made, such as playing the Beam of Light, but before they choose two Phrups. If they did not pause to give you an opportunity to Time Lapse the Beam, declaring they would use it on the two Phrups before you had the chance to say you were Time Lapsing it, then you may force them to allow you to use Time Lapse, even with the knowledge of what they intended. But if they have given you the opportunity to use Time Lapse, you declined, and then they decided to affect one of your Phrups, it is too late to decide and use Time Lapse.

        What happens if I attack an Elder Yark under Kioko's control with a Granas if I play a Sneak Attack?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        As soon as the Granas is declared as attacking the Elder Yark, the following trigger occurs: Sneak Attack - Attacker (Attacking Player), Sneak Attack - Defender (Attacking Player), Motivate (Defending Player), Demotivate (Defending Player), Regal Presence (Defending Player). The attacking player, as the active player, resolves their effects first and chooses whether to make the attacker or defender discard starting energy instead of current energy. Then, the defending player, as the inactive player, resolves their own effects and decides whether to Motivate or Demotivate, and when to resolve Regal Presence. If Regal Presence is resolved before Demotivate, Demotivate can still be used to revert the amount discarded back to starting energy if desired by the defender. Ultimately, the defending player has final control over the outcome. Additionally, Pummel increases the amount of energy the Granas discards by one.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Firefly Swarm cannot target a Lovian even with a Sword of Light in play. The Lovian's ability prevents non-Arderial spells from affecting him, and this targeting restriction cannot be overridden by the Sword of Light. According to Magi-Nation's effects-based ruling system, you cannot play a spell that has no legal targets or would have no effect—since Firefly Swarm cannot affect the Lovian due to his immunity, it cannot be played against him. The Sword of Light does not remove targeting restrictions; it only modifies damage after the target is validly chosen.

        The phrase "restore a Creature to its starting energy" is shorthand for "set the chosen Creature's energy at its starting energy."

Would it matter if it was Gyrg's Pylofuf that was stalked/would it still lose three? Does the mechanic of "stalk" take precedent or Digging Mastery? In this situation it would seem that Digging mastery caps the total damage from all sources at 2 during each attack.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Stalking Burrow - Energy removed by stalking happens during an attack, so it is counted in Gyrg's cap. Burrow will do nothing to prevent it, and so in your example the Pylofuf loses one energy from being stalked, then up to one more from the attack (thanks to Gyrg's cap).

        The 7 energy Bagala Hunter is attacking a 7 energy Rock Hyren. Does the Rock Hyren lose one from the stalking taking it down to 6, or does it stay at 7 since it has invulnerability?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        The Rock Hyren would be defeated. Stalking discards one energy from the Hyren, then when energy is discarded, the seven energy discarded by the Bagala Hunter is reduced to six by Invulnerability, then the Hyren's remaining six is discarded and it is defeated.

        If I use Taglet's Power of Dream Cross to copy Tar Hyren's Cling Effect after playing a Taglet, and then attack a creature with higher energy than my Taglet, does the Taglet retain the copied Cling Effect even though it is defeated in combat?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, the Taglet will stay attached to the creature and function as if it were a Tar Hyren due to the copied Cling Effect until the beginning of your next turn. At that point, the Cling effect ends, leaving the Taglet as a Creature card with zero energy, which is immediately discarded. Although the Taglet remains a Creature card after losing Cling, it has no way to stay in play without energy, so it is discarded. This also means that if Cling were somehow locked down (e.g., by an effect preventing attachment), the Tar Hyren would be discarded from play—preventing situations where a creature with no energy could remain attached and potentially gain energy again.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        You may discard the creature for Martyr to prevent the energy from being discarded from the Magi.

        Can Sorreah's Dream discard 1 energy from my opponent's Mushroom Hyren to send it back to his hand?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, you cannot use Sorreah's Dream to discard energy from your opponent's Mushroom Hyren. When using Sorreah's Dream to copy a Power, the cost is paid by the Dream itself, not by the card with the Power. Additionally, you can only choose creatures you control when copying Sanctuary, so you may not target your opponent's Hyren.

        Can Grej and Prek be considered dual region magi and played as such, given that they were the first magi who could play cards from each other's regions?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        We were playtesting dual-region Magi long before Grej, Prek, and Evil Evu were released (as he could effectively be looked at as "Core/Naroom"). If they were intended to be truly dual-region, they would have been printed as such.

        If I use Nagisis to corrupt Koll, could I still use his power to dream twist Kybar's Teeth creatures? Similarly, as a Shadow Magi now, could Koll dream twist Core creatures?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Dream Twist would have to specify 'play a Kybar's Teeth Creature regardless of region' to allow a corrupted Koll to play it. Without the 'regardless of region' clause, Dream Twist cannot override the regional restrictions imposed by the playing cards ruleset. Koll could still play a creature from the region specified in Dream Twist, but only if that creature is playable by a Kybar's Teeth Shadow Magi.

      <div class="clarification-question">
        There appears to be a contradiction between two rules statements regarding 'move' effects: one says the discard and addition are dependent on each other, while another states they are not linked—specifically, that increasing the energy discarded does not increase the amount added. How should these be reconciled?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Cards that reduce the energy discard of a move effect reduce the amount of energy added by the move effect; however, cards that increase the energy discard do not increase the energy added. This is the essence of what Steve and I were saying, but we ended up in a situation where 'the right hand did not realize what the left hand was doing' when phrasing some of our previous answers.

        What is the correct way to interpret 'Move' effects in terms of energy transfer between sources?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Whenever a Spell, Power, or Effect requires you to move energy from one source to another, you discard the specified amount from the source being moved from and add that same amount to the destination source. Cards that increase the energy discarded do not increase the energy added; however, cards that reduce the energy discarded also reduce the energy added by a corresponding amount. This mechanic is based on real-life logic: if you move less than the full amount (e.g., a gallon minus a cup), you only add what was actually moved; similarly, if more is discarded due to effects, it doesn't result in extra energy being added—only the actual amount moved is transferred.

        If I use Abwyn's Quill with Forgotten Dancer to change a region and take control of a creature, can I use Abwyn's Quill again later in the game or on the same turn with another Forgotten Dancer to overwrite a different instance?
      </div>
      <div class="clarification-answer">
        Yes, 'Once per Spell or Power' means you can only Overwrite one specific instance of a Spell or Power, not that you cannot use Overwrite on the same Power again later in the game. You may play another Forgotten Dancer on the same turn and use Overwrite on it to change a region and take control of another creature.

      <div class="clarification-answer">
        No, Grej cannot play Crushing Fungus. Although Grej can play Underneath cards and ignore regional penalties and restrictions, Crushing Fungus has a specific restriction that only Underneath Magi and Underneath Shadow Magi can play it, and Grej does not meet this requirement.

        The active player must resolve all of their Effects first. Your opponent would have to choose what they wish to Dreamwarp their Creature to, then you would be able to choose if and how you would like to Dreamwarp it.
